For instance, if you want to write a letter to the editor of your favorite magazine you'd get out a notepad (or open a word processor) and start filling it with your thoughts. The same is true with WebGUI. Create a page, then add your content to the page.
<p>

<b>Title</b><br>
The title of the page is what your users will use to navigate through the site. Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.
<p>


<b>Menu Title</b><br>
A shorter or altered title to appear in navigation. If left blank this will default to <i>Title</i>.
<p>

<b>URL</b><br>
You may either specify a URL for the asset, or if you leave this blank, a URL based on the <b>Title</b> will be generated.
<p>

<b>Redirect URL</b><br>
When this page is visited, the user will be redirected to the URL specified here. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The redirects will be disabled while in admin mode in order to make it easier to edit the properties of the page.
<p>


<b>Hide from navigation?</b><br>
Select yes to prevent this asset from being displayed in Navigation Assets.
<p>
<B>NOTE:</b> This will not hide the page from the page tree (Administrative functions... &gt; Manage page tree.), only from navigation assets, such as menus and site maps.
<p>

<b>Open in new window?</b><br>
Select yes to open this page in a new window. This is often used in conjunction with the <b>Redirect URL</b> parameter.
<p>

<b>Encrypt content?</b><br>
Select yes to serve this page over SSL.
<p>



<b>Language</b><br/>
Choose the default language for this page. All WebGUI generated messages will appear in that language and the character set will be changed to the character set for that language.
<p/>

<P><B>Cache Timeout</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for registered users. 

<P><B>Cache Timeout (Visitors)</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for visitors. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Page caching is only available if your administrator has installed the Cache::FileCache Perl module. Using page caching can improve site performance by as much as 1000%.&nbsp;


<P><b>Template</b><br>
By default, WebGUI has one big content area to place wobjects. However, by specifying a template other than the default you can sub-divide the content area into several sections.
<p>

<b>Synopsis</b><br>
A short description of a page. 
<p>

<b>Meta Tags</b><br>
Meta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. You can find a  <a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/mk-metas.html">little utility here</a> that will help you build meta tags if you've never done it before.
<p>

<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the  area of your pages, you may put them here as well.
<p>

<b>Use default meta tags?</b><br>
If you don't wish to specify meta tags yourself, WebGUI can generate meta tags based on the page title and your company's name. Check this box to enable the WebGUI-generated meta tags.
<p>


<b>Style</b><br>
By default, when you create a page, it inherits a few traits from its parent. One of those traits is style. Choose from the list of styles if you would like to change the appearance of this page. See <i>Add Style</i> for more details.
<p>

<b>Printable Style</b><br>
This sets the printable style for this page to be something other than the WebGUI Default Printable Style.
<p>

<b>Start Date</b><br>
The date when users may begin viewing this page. Note that before this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>

<b>End Date</b><br>
The date when users will stop viewing this page. Note that after this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>

<b>Owner</b><br>
The owner of a page is usually the person who created the page. This user always has full edit and viewing rights on the page.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The owner can only be changed by an administrator.
<p>


<b>Who can view?</b><br>
Choose which group can view this page. If you want both visitors and registered users to be able to view the page then you should choose the "Everybody" group.
<p>

<b>Who can edit?</b><br>
Choose the group that can edit this page. The group assigned editing rights can also always view the page.
<p>

<b>Recursively set privileges?</b><br>
You can optionally give the privileges of this page to all pages under this page.
<p>

<b>What next?</b><br/>
If you leave this on the default setting you'll be redirected to the new page after creating it.

The the content on the current page.
<p>

<b>head.tags</b><br>
Tags that WebGUI automatically generates for you so that caching works the way it should, search engines can find you better, and other useful automated functionality. This should go in the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; section of your style.

<p>
We suggest using something like this in the &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; portion of your style:
<p>

&lt;tmpl_var session.page.title&gt; - &lt;tmpl_var session.setting.companyName&gt;

<p>
That particular example will help you get good ranking on search engines.

Admins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.
<p>

<b>Content Managers</b><br>
Content managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.
<p>

<b>Everyone</b><br>
Everyone is a magic group in that no one is ever physically inserted into it, but yet all members of the site are part of it. If you want to open up your site to both visitors and registered users, use this group to do it.
<p>

<b>Export Managers</b><br>
Members of this group are allowed to export pages to disk.
<p>

<b>Package Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to add, edit, and delete packages of wobjects and pages to deploy.
<p>

<b>Registered Users</b><br>
When users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.
<p>

<b>Secondary Admins</b><br>
Users in the Secondary Admins group may add new users, but cannot edit users. Also, if 
you are a Secondary Admin for a group, you may modify the membership of that group.
<p>

<b>Style Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit styles for this site. These privileges do not allow the user to assign styles to a page, just define them to be used.
<p>

<b>Template Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit templates for this site.
<p>

<b>Theme Managers</b><br>
Users in this group can use the theme manager to create new themes and install themes from other systems.
<p>

<b>Turn Admin On</b><br>
These users are allowed to turn on Admin mode.
<p>

<b>Visitors</b><br>
Visitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system. Also, if you wish to punish a registered user you could remove him/her from the Registered Users group and insert him/her into the Visitors group.

You also cannot import a theme from a version of WebGUI that is newer than the one you're using. Therefore if you are using WebGUI 5.2.4 and a theme was created with WebGUI 6.0.0, then you will not be allowed to import the theme until you upgrade.

<p>

<b>Group Name</b><br>
A name for the group. It is best if the name is descriptive so you know what it is at a glance.
<p>

<b>Description</b><br>
A longer description of the group so that other admins and content managers (or you if you forget) will know what the purpose of this group is.
<p>

<b>Expire Offset</b><br>
The amount of time that a user will belong to this group before s/he is expired (or removed) from it. This is very useful for membership sites where users have certain privileges for a specific period of time. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This can be overridden on a per-user basis.
<p>

<b>Notify user about expiration?</b><br>
Set this value to yes if you want WebGUI to contact the user when they are about to be expired from the group.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the notification. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the notification to be sent on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the notification to go out 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the notification to be sent 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Message</b><br>
Type the message you wish to be sent to the user telling them about the expiration.
<p>

<b>Delete Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the grouping being deleted from the system. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the grouping to be deleted on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the grouping to be deleted 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the grouping to be deleted 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Scratch Filter</b><br>
A user can be dynamically bound to a group by a scratch variable in their session. Scratch variables can be set programatically, or via the web. To set a scratch variable via the web, tack the following on to the end of any URL:
<p>
<i>?op=setScratch&amp;scratchName=somename&amp;scratchValue=somevalue</i>
<p>
Having done that, when a user clicks on that link they will have a scratch variable added to their session with a name of "www_somename" and a value of "somevalue". The "www_" is prefixed to prevent web requests from overwriting scratch variables that were set programatically.
<p>
To set a scratch filter simply add a line to the scratch filter field that looks like:
<p>
<i>www_somename=somevalue</i>
<p>

<b>IP Address</b><br>
Specify an IP address or an IP mask to match. If the user's IP address matches, they'll automatically be included in this group. An IP mask is simply the IP address minus an octet or two. You may also specify multiple IP masks separated by semicolons.
<p>
<i>IP Mask Example:</i> 10.;192.168.;101.42.200.142
<p>

<b>Karma Threshold</b><br>
If you've enabled Karma, then you'll be able to set this value. Karma Threshold is the amount of karma a user must have to be considered part of this group.
<p>

<b>Users can add themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users add themselves to this group? See the GroupAdd macro for more info.
<p>

<b>Users can remove themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users remove themselves from this group? See the GroupDelete macro for more info.
<p>

<i>The following options are recommended only for advanced WebGUI administrators.</i>
<p>

<b>Database Link</b><br>
If you'd like to have this group validate users using an external database, choose the database link to use.
<p>

<b>SQL Query</b><br>
Many organizations have external databases that map users to groups; for example an HR database might map Employee ID to Health Care Plan.  To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with "select 1".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user's profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional WebGUI profile field called employeeId.<br>
<br>
select 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>
where employees.employee_id = &#94;User("employeeId");<br>
and health_plans.plan_name = 'HMO 1'<br>
and employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>
and health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>
<br>
This group could then be named "Employees in HMO 1", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.
<p>

<b>Cache external groups for how long?</b><br>
Large sites using external group data will be making many calls to the external database.  To help reduce the load, you may select how long you'd like to cache the results of the external database query within the WebGUI database.  More advanced background caching may be included in a future version of WebGUI.|,

<p>
The following style sheet classes are available:
<p>

<b>.tab</b><br>
The default look of each tab.
<p>

<b>div.tabs</b><br>
This also sets some properties for all of the tabs. This should be used for the text labels in the tabs.
<p>


<b>.tabBody</b><br>
The content area for each tab. This is where the form will show up. Note that for best results the background color of this should match the background color of .tabActive.
<p>


<b>.tabHover</b><br>
The look of a tab as the mouse hovers over it.
<p>

<b>.tabActive</b><br>
The look of the tab that is currently visible.

<br><br>

<b>Thumbnail Size</b><br>
The size of the longest side of thumbnails. The thumbnail generation maintains the aspect ratio of the image. Therefore, if this value is set to 100, and you have an image that's 400 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall, the thumbnail will be 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall.

The web-path of the directory where attachments are to be stored.
<br><br>

<b>Server Attachment Path</b><br>
The local path of the directory where attachments are to be stored. (Perhaps /var/www/public/uploads) Be sure that the web server has the rights to write to that directory.

<p>


If you are unfamiliar with how to use CSS, <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">Plain Black</a> provides training classes on XHTML and CSS. Alternatively, Bradsoft makes an excellent CSS editor called <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style</a>.
<p>


The following is a list of classes used to control the default look of WebGUI. These of course can be overridden or replaced in the various templates that generate them.
<p>


<b>A</b><br>
The links throughout the style.
<p>


<b>BODY</b><br>
The default setup of all pages within a style.
<p>


<b>H1</b><br>
The headers on every page.
<p>


<b>.content</b><br>
The main content area on all pages of the style.
<p>


<b>.formDescription </b><br>
The tags on all forms next to the form elements. 
<p>


<b>.formSubtext </b><br>
The tags below some form elements.
<p>


<b>.highlight </b><br>
Denotes a highlighted item, such as which message you are viewing within a list.
<p>




<b>.pagination </b><br>
The Previous and Next links on pages with pagination.
<p>




<b>.tableData </b><br>
The data rows on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>


<b>.tableHeader </b><br>
The headings of columns on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>




<b>NOTE:</b> Some wobjects and macros have their own unique styles sheet classes, which are documented in their individual help files.

		message => q|Settings allow you to customize WebGUI's default values to satisfy your particular needs.
<br /><br />
		<b>Use shared clipboard?</b><br>
Enables a single, system-wide clipboard shared by all users.  Default is user separated clipboards.
<p>

<b>Use shared trash?</b><br>
Enables a single, system-wide trash shared by all users.  Default is user separated trash.
<p>

<b>If proxied, use real client IP address?</b><br>
If enabled and if the environment variable HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is present, it's value will be used in place of REMOTE_ADDRESS as the client browser's IP address.  This is required for IP based groups to function properly in reverse-proxied, load-balanced system architectures.  In these environments, all requests would otherwise appear to come from the same host, namely the proxy server.  If you are uncertain if you need this setting enabled, you should probably leave it turned off.
<p>

<b>Prevent Proxy Caching</b><br>
Some companies have proxy servers that cause problems with WebGUI. If you're experiencing problems with WebGUI, and you have a proxy server, you may want to set this setting to <i>Yes</i>. Beware that WebGUI's URLs will not be as user-friendly after this feature is turned on.
<p>

<b>Show debugging?</b><br>
Show debugging information in WebGUI's output. This is primarily useful for WebGUI developers, but can also be interesting for Administrators trying to troubleshoot a problem.
<p>

<b>Track page statistics?</b><br/>
WebGUI can track some statistical information for your site. However, this will add a little extra strain on your processor and will make your database grow much more quickly. Enable this only if you do not have an external web statistics program.
<p/>


<b>Host To Use</b><br>
Select which host to use by default when generating URLs. Config Sitename will use the "sitename" variable from your config file. And Env HTTP Host will use the "HTTP_HOST" environment variable provided by the web server.
<p>

		<b>Company Name</b><br>
The name of your company. It will appear on all emails and anywhere you use the Company Name style macro.
<br><br>

<b>Company Email Address</b><br>
A general email address at your company. This is the address that all automated messages will come from. It can also be used via Company Email Address style macro.
<br><br>

<b>Company URL</b><br>
The primary URL of your company. This will appear on all automated emails sent from the WebGUI system. It is also available via the Company URL style macro.


		<B>Default Home Page</B><BR>Some really small sites don't have a home page, but instead like to use one of their internal pages like "About Us" or "Company Information" as their home page. For that reason, you can set the default page of your site to any page in the site. That page will be the one people go to if they type in just your URL http://www.mywebguisite.com, or if they click on the Home link generated by an AssetProxy of a Navigation Asset. 

<P><B>Not Found Page</B><BR>If a page that a user requests is not found in the system, the user can either be redirected to the home page or to an error page where they can attempt to find what they were looking for. You decide which is better for your users. 

<p><b>URL Extension</b><br />Add an extension such as "html", "php", or "asp" to each new page URL as it is created. <p><b>NOTE:</b> Do NOT include the dot "." in this. So the field should look like "html" not ".html".

<P><B>Maximum Attachment Size</B><BR>The size (in kilobytes) of the maximum allowable attachment to be uploaded to your system. 

<P><B>Max Image Size</B><BR>If images are uploaded to your system that are bigger than the max image size, then they will be resized to the max image size. The max image size is measured in pixels and will use the size of the longest side of the image to determine if the limit has been reached. 

<P><B>Thumbnail Size</B><BR>When images are uploaded to your system, they will automatically have thumbnails generated at the size specified here (unless overridden on a case-by-case basis). Thumbnail size is measured in pixels. 

<p><b>Default Rich Editor</b><br />
This is the rich editor configuration that will be used by default when a rich editor is needed. This can be overridden in certain applications such as the Collaboration System.</p>

<B>Text Area Rows</B>, <B>Text Area Columns</B> and <B>Text Box Size</B> allow the size of
forms that WebGUI generates to be customized on a site-by-site basis.

<P><B>Text Area Rows</B><BR>This setting specifies how many rows of characters will be displayed in textareas on the site.

<P><B>Text Area Columns</B><BR>This setting specifies how many columns of characters will be displayed in textareas on the site. 

<P><B>Text Box Size</B><BR>This setting specifies how many characters can be displayed at once in text boxes on the site. 


<p><b>Anonymous Registration</b><br>
Do you wish visitors to your site to be able to register themselves?
<br><br>

<b>Run On Registration</b><br>
If there is a command line specified here, it will be executed each time a user registers anonymously.
<p>

<b>Enable Karma?</b><br>
Should karma be enabled?
<p>

<b>Karma Per Login</b><br>
The amount of karma a user should be given when they log in. This only takes affect if karma is enabled.
<p>

<b>Session Timeout</b><br>
The amount of time that a user session remains active (before needing to log in again). This timeout is reset each time a user views a page. Therefore if you set the timeout for 8 hours, a user would have to log in again if s/he hadn't visited the site for 8 hours.
<p>

<b>Allow users to deactivate their account?</b><br>
Do you wish to provide your users with a means to deactivate their account without your intervention?
<p>

<b>Authentication Method (default)</b><br>
What should the default authentication method be for new accounts that are created? The two available options are WebGUI and LDAP. WebGUI authentication means that the users will authenticate against the username and password stored in the WebGUI database. LDAP authentication means that users will authenticate against an external LDAP server.
<br><br>

<i>NOTE:</i> Authentication settings can be customized on a per user basis.



<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Depending upon what authentication modules you have installed in your system you'll see any number of options after this point. The following are the options for the two authentication methods installed by default.
<p>

<b>Encrypt Login?</b><br>
Should the system use the HTTPS protocol for the login form?  Note that setting this option to true will only encrypt the authentication itself, not anything else before or after the authentication.
<p>

<h2>WebGUI Authentication Options</h2>

<b>Minimum Password Length</b><br>
Set the minimum length that passwords can be.  If set to 0, there is no minimum length.
<br><br>

<b>Password Timeout</b><br>
Set how long before a user's password expires and has to change it.
<br><br>

<b>Expire passwords on user creation?</b><br>
Should a user's password be expired when he is created by an administrator forcing a change?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Username?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their Usernames?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Password?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their passwords?
<br><br>

<b>Send welcome message?</b><br>
Do you wish WebGUI to automatically send users a welcome message when they register for your site? 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> In addition to the message you specify below, the user's account information will be included in the message.
<p>

<b>Welcome Message</b> <br>
Type the message that you'd like to be sent to users upon registration.
<p>

<b>Recover Password Message</b><br>
Type a message that will be sent to your users if they try to recover their WebGUI password.
<p>



<h2>LDAP Authentication Options</h2>

<b>LDAP URL (default)</b><br>
The default url to your LDAP server. The LDAP URL takes the form of <b>ldap://[server]:[port]/[base DN]</b>. Example: ldap://ldap.mycompany.com:389/o=MyCompany.
<br><br>




<b>LDAP Identity</b><br>
The LDAP Identity is the unique identifier in the LDAP server that the user will be identified against. Often this field is <b>shortname</b>, which takes the form of first initial + last name. Example: jdoe. Therefore if you specify the LDAP identity to be <i>shortname</i> then Jon Doe would enter <i>jdoe</i> during the registration process.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Identity Name</b><br>
The label used to describe the LDAP Identity to the user. For instance, some companies use an LDAP server for their proxy server users to authenticate against. In the documentation or training already provided to their users, the LDAP identity is known as their <i>Web Username</i>. So you could enter that label here for consistency.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Password Name</b><br>
Just as the LDAP Identity Name is a label, so is the LDAP Password Name. Use this label as you would LDAP Identity Name.

However, this can expose pose a risk to your site, for example, through cross-site scripting attacks.</p>
<p>To help solve this problem
many Assets have a <b>^International("418","WebGUI");</b> property that performs various leveling
of filtering on content.  Each one is pretty self-explanatory:
<dl>
<dt>^International("420","WebGUI");</dd>
<dd>No filtering will be done.  All original content will be displayed.</dd>
<dt>^International("891","WebGUI");</dt>

will be shown;</dd>

<dd>Negates WebGUI Macros. Removes the contents of &lt;script&gt; tags and deletes
JavaScript fields from HTML tags.</dd>
<dt>^International("421","WebGUI");</dt>

<dt>^International("419","WebGUI");</dt>
<dd>Strips everything that it can, returning just plain old, safe text.</dd>

<b>Assets</b><br>
Everything inside of WebGUI is an Asset: files, images, forums, threads in forums, posts in threads, templates, Wobjects (like Articles, DataForms, EventsCalendars) and more.
<p>

<b>locked</b><br>
If Posts and Threads are "locked", no new posts can be added and no existing posts can be edited.
<p>

<b>Macros</b><br>
Macros are used to create dynamic content within content that would otherwise be unchanging.  For
example, showing today's date, or the name of the user on a page can be done with Macros.
<p>

<b>sticky</b><br>
If Posts and Threads are set to being "sticky", they will appear at the top of the Forum listing.
<p>

<b>UI level</b><br>
For WebGUI Content Managers and Admins, the Asset and Wobject edit
screens can be configured to make them easier to use, based on each
user's UI level.  The UI level can be altered by Admins in the user's profile.
<p>

<b>Wobjects</b><br>
If you think of Assets as "things" inside of WebGUI, then Wobject are
"things" that "do stuff".  Articles are used to display content, DataForms
are for collecting data from users (and optionally emailing a copy), and
Message Boards hold forums for users.  There are many different Wobjects in WebGUI.
