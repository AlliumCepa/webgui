	1054 => q|Forum (Discussion) Properties|,

	1055 => q|WebGUI has a very powerful built-in discussion system. It can be attached to anything and is attached to many wobjects.
<p>
Forums (aka Discussions) have many settable properties. The following is a comprehensive list:
<p>

<b>Forum Template</b><br>
A template that controls the layout of the forum view.
<p>

<b>Thread Template</b><br>
A template that controls the layout of the thread view.
<p>

<b>Post Template</b><br>
A template that controls the layout of the post view.
<p>

<b>Search Template</b><br>
A template that controls the layout of the search engine interface and search results.
<p>

<b>Post Form Template</b><br>
A template that controls the form that users see when posting a new message.
<p>

<b>Notification Template</b><br>
A template that controls the layout of subscription notification messages sent to users.
<p>

<b>Archive After</b><br>
If a thread hasn't had a new message after this interval has expired then it will be flagged as "archived" and will only be accessible via the search engine.
<p>

<b>Edit Timeout</b><br>
The interval of time that the user has to edit their message after their inital post.
<p>
<i>NOTE:</i> Don't set this limit too high. One of the great things about discussions is that they are an accurate record of who said what. If you allow editing for a long time, then a user has a chance to go back and change his/her mind a long time after the original statement was made.
<p>

<b>Add edit stamp to posts?</b><br>
If set to yes then a string will be added to the bottom of a post each time its edited.
<p>

<b>Allow rich edit?</b><br>
If set to yes then users will be able to use a rich editor when writing their posts.
<p>

<b>Allow replacements?</b><br>
If set to yes then users will be able to use replacements in thier posts. Replacements can be managed from the settings.
<p>

<b>Filter Post</b><br>
Select what types of content you will filter from a user's post.
<p>

<b>Posts Per Page</b><br>
The number of posts to display on a single page.
<p>

<b>Karma Per Post</b><br>
How much karma should be given to a user when they post a message?
<p>

<b>Who can post?</b><br>
A group that is allowed to post new messages.
<p>

<b>Moderate posts?</b><br>
If set to yes then posts will be set to pending by default and will not be displayed until a moderator approves the message.
<p>

<b>Who can moderate?</b><br>
A group that is allowed to moderate messages.

Which collateral folder should this image be placed in.
<p/>

	795 => q|Roots|,

	794 => q|Packages|,

	793 => q|Pieces of Collateral|,

	792 => q|Templates|,

	633 => q|Simply put, roots are pages with no parent. The first and most important root in WebGUI is the "Home" page. Many people will never add any additional roots, but a few power users will. Those power users will create new roots for many different reasons. Perhaps they'll create a staging area for content managers. Or maybe a hidden area for Admin tools. Or possibly even a new root just to place their search engine.
<p>

|,

	636 => q|To create a package follow these simple steps:

<ol>
<li> From the admin menu select "Manage packages."
</li>

<li> Add a page and give it a name. The name of the page will be the name of the package.
</li>

<li> Go to the new page you created and start adding pages and wobjects. Any pages or wobjects you add will be created each time this package is deployed. 
</li>
</ol>

<b>Notes:</b><br>
In order to add, edit, or delete packages you must be in the Package Mangers group or in the Admins group.
<br><br>

If you add content to any of the wobjects, that content will automatically be copied when the package is deployed.
<br><br>

Privileges and styles assigned to pages in the package will not be copied when the package is deployed. Instead the pages will take the privileges and styles of the area to which they are deployed.
<p>
|,

	635 => q|Packages are groups of pages and wobjects that are predefined to be deployed together. A package manager may see the need to create a package several pages with a message board, an FAQ, and a Poll because that task is performed quite often. Packages are often defined to lessen the burden of repetitive tasks.
<br><br>
One package that many people create is a Page/Article package. It is often the case that you want to add a page with an article on it for content. Instead of going through the steps of creating a page, going to the page, and then adding an article to the page, you may wish to simply create a package to do those steps all at once.|,

	630 => q|WebGUI has a small, but sturdy real-time search engine built-in. If you wish to use the internal search engine, you can use the ^?; macro, or by adding <i>?op=search</i> to the end of any URL, or feel free to build your own form to access it.
<p>
Many people need a search engine to index their WebGUI site, plus many others. Or they have more advanced needs than what WebGUI's search engine allows. In those cases we recommend <a href="http://www.mnogosearch.org/">MnoGo Search</a> or <a href="http://www.htdig.org/">ht://Dig</a>.
<p>

|,

	611 => q|<b>Company Name</b><br>
The name of your company. It will appear on all emails and anywhere you use the Company Name macro.
<br><br>

<b>Company Email Address</b><br>
A general email address at your company. This is the address that all automated messages will come from. It can also be used via the WebGUI macro system.
<br><br>

<b>Company URL</b><br>
The primary URL of your company. This will appear on all automated emails sent from the WebGUI system. It is also available via the WebGUI macro system.
|,

	651 => q|If you choose to empty your trash, any items contained in it will be lost forever. If you're unsure about a few items, it might be best to cut them to your clipboard before you empty the trash.
<p>

|,

	627 => q|Profiles are used to extend the information of a particular user. In some cases profiles are important to a site, in others they are not. The profiles system is completely extensible. You can add as much information to the users profile as you like.
<p>

|,

	629 => q|<b>Use shared clipboard?</b><br>
Enables a single, system-wide clipboard shared by all users.  Default is user separated clipboards.
<p>

<b>Use shared trash?</b><br>
Enables a single, system-wide trash shared by all users.  Default is user separated trash.
<p>

<b>If proxied, use real client IP address?</b><br>
If enabled and if the environment variable HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is present, it's value will be used in place of REMOTE_ADDRESS as the client browser's IP address.  This is required for IP based groups to function properly in reverse-proxied, load-balanced system architectures.  In these environments, all requests would otherwise appear to come from the same host, namely the proxy server.  If you are uncertain if you need this setting enabled, you should probably leave it turned off.
<p>

<b>Prevent Proxy Caching</b><br>
Some companies have proxy servers that cause problems with WebGUI. If you're experiencing problems with WebGUI, and you have a proxy server, you may want to set this setting to <i>Yes</i>. Beware that WebGUI's URLs will not be as user-friendly after this feature is turned on.
<p>

<b>Show debugging?</b><br>
Show debugging information in WebGUI's output. This is primarily useful for WebGUI developers, but can also be interesting for Administrators trying to troubleshoot a problem.
<p>

<b>Track page statistics?</b><br/>
WebGUI can track some statistical information for your site. However, this will add a little extra strain on your processor and will make your database grow much more quickly. Enable this only if you do not have an external web statistics program.
<p/>


<b>Host To Use</b><br>
Select which host to use by default when generating URLs. Config Sitename will use the "sitename" variable from your config file. And Env HTTP Host will use the "HTTP_HOST" environment variable provided by the web server.
<p>
|,

	616 => q|<b>Path to WebGUI Extras</b><br>
The web-path to the directory containing WebGUI images and javascript files.
<br><br>

<b>Maximum Attachment Size</b><br>
The maximum size of files allowed to be uploaded to this site. This applies to all wobjects that allow uploaded files and images (like Article and User Contributions). This size is measured in kilobytes.
<br><br>

<b>Thumbnail Size</b><br>
The size of the longest side of thumbnails. The thumbnail generation maintains the aspect ratio of the image. Therefore, if this value is set to 100, and you have an image that's 400 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall, the thumbnail will be 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall.
<p>
<i>Note:</i> Thumbnails are automatically generated as images are uploaded to the system.
<p>

<b>Web Attachment Path</b><br>
The web-path of the directory where attachments are to be stored.
<br><br>

<b>Server Attachment Path</b><br>
The local path of the directory where attachments are to be stored. (Perhaps /var/www/public/uploads) Be sure that the web server has the rights to write to that directory.

	885 => q|Allow users to deactivate their account?|,

	626 => q|Wobjects (fomerly known as Widgets) are the true power of WebGUI. Wobjects are tiny pluggable applications built to run under WebGUI. Message boards and polls are examples of wobjects.
<p>

To add a wobject to a page, first go to that page, then select <i>Add Content...</i> from the upper left corner of your screen. Each wobject has it's own help so be sure to read the help if you're not sure how to use it.
<p>


<i>Style Sheets</i>: All wobjects have a style-sheet class and id attached to them. 
<p>

The style-sheet class is the word "wobject" plus the type of wobject it is. So for a poll the class would be "wobjectPoll". The class pertains to all wobjects of that type in the system. 
<p>

The style-sheet id is the word "wobjectId" plus the Wobject Id for that wobject instance. So if you had an Article with a Wobject Id of 94, then the id would be "wobjectId94".
<p>

|,

	632 => q|You can add wobjects by selecting from the <I>Add Content</I> pulldown menu. You can edit them by clicking on the "Edit" button that appears directly above an instance of a particular wobject. 
<P>Almost all wobjects share some properties. Those properties are: 
<P><B>Wobject ID</B><BR>This is the unique identifier WebGUI uses to keep track of this wobject instance. Normal users should never need to be concerned with the Wobject ID, but some advanced users may need to know it for things like SQL Reports. 
<P><B>Title</B> The title of the wobject. This is typically displayed at the top of each wobject. 
<P><I>Note:</I> You should always specify a title even if you are going to turn it off (with the next property). This is because the title shows up in the trash and clipboard and you'll want to be able to distinguish which wobject is which. 
<P><B>Display title?</B><BR>Do you wish to display the title you specified? On some sites, displaying the title is not necessary. 
<P><B>Process macros?</B><BR>Do you wish to process macros in the content of this wobject? Sometimes you'll want to do this, but more often than not you'll want to say "no" to this question. By disabling the processing of macros on the wobjects that don't use them, you'll speed up your web server slightly. 
<P><B>Template Position</B><BR>Template positions range from 0 (zero) to any number. How many are available depends upon the Template associated with this page. The default template has only one template position, others may have more. By selecting a template position, you're specifying where this wobject should be placed within the template. 
<P><B>Start Date</B><BR>On what date should this wobject become visible? Before this date, the wobject will only be displayed to Content Managers. 
<P><B>End Date</B><BR>On what date should this wobject become invisible? After this date, the wobject will only be displayed to Content Managers. <BR><BR><B>Owner</B><BR>The owner of a&nbsp;wobject is usually the person who created the wobject. This user&nbsp;has full edit and viewing rights on the wobject unless privileges to edit the page the wobject apears on are taken away. 
<P><B>NOTE:</B> The owner can only be changed by an administrator. 
<P><B>Who can view?</B><BR>Choose which group can view this wobject. If you want both visitors and registered users to be able to view the&nbsp;wobject then you should choose the "Everybody" group. 
<P><B>Who can edit?</B><BR>Choose the group that can edit this wobject. The group assigned editing rights can also always view the wobject. </P>
<P><B>Description</B><BR>A content area in which you can place as much content as you wish. For instance, even before an FAQ there is usually a paragraph describing what is contained in the FAQ. 
<P></P>|,

	623 => q|<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> are a great way to manage the look and feel of any web site. They are used extensively in WebGUI.
<p>


If you are unfamiliar with how to use CSS, <a href="http://www.plainblack.com/">Plain Black</a> provides training classes on XHTML and CSS. Alternatively, Bradsoft makes an excellent CSS editor called <a href="http://www.bradsoft.com/topstyle/index.asp">Top Style</a>.
<p>


The following is a list of classes used to control the default look of WebGUI. These of course can be overridden or replaced in the various templates that generate them.
<p>


<b>A</b><br>
The links throughout the style.
<p>


<b>BODY</b><br>
The default setup of all pages within a style.
<p>


<b>H1</b><br>
The headers on every page.
<p>


<b>.content</b><br>
The main content area on all pages of the style.
<p>


<b>.formDescription </b><br>
The tags on all forms next to the form elements. 
<p>


<b>.formSubtext </b><br>
The tags below some form elements.
<p>


<b>.highlight </b><br>
Denotes a highlighted item, such as which message you are viewing within a list.
<p>




<b>.pagination </b><br>
The Previous and Next links on pages with pagination.
<p>




<b>.tableData </b><br>
The data rows on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>


<b>.tableHeader </b><br>
The headings of columns on things like message boards and user contributions.
<p>




<b>NOTE:</b> Some wobjects and macros have their own unique styles sheet classes, which are documented in their individual help files.
<p>


|,

	846 => q|These macros are mainly useful in maintaining styles in WebGUI.
<p/>

<b>&#94;AdminBar;</b><br>
Places the administrative tool bar on the page. This is a required element in the "body" segment of the Style Manager. This macro uses a style sheet class called <i>.adminBar </i>, which you may want to account for in your style.

<p>


<b>&#94;c; - Company Name</b><br>
The name of your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>


<b>&#94;e; - Company Email Address</b><br>
The email address for your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>

<b>&#94;Extras;</b><br>
Returns the path to the WebGUI "extras" folder, which contains things like WebGUI icons.
<p>

<b>&#94;LastModified; or &#94;LastModified();</b><br>
Displays the date that the current page was last modified based upon the wobjects on the page. The date is defaultly displayed based upon the user's date preferences. Optionally, it can take two parameters. The first is text to display before the date. The second is a date format string (see the D (date) macro for details.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;LastModified("Updated: ","%c %D, %y");
<p>


<b>&#94;PageTitle;</b><br>
Displays the title of the current page.
<p>

<B>NOTE:</b> If you begin using admin functions or the indepth functions of any wobject, the page title will become a link that will quickly bring you back to the page.
<p>

<b>&#94;r; or &#94;r(); - Make Page Printable</b><br>
Creates a link to remove the style from a page to make it printable.  In addition, you can change the link text by creating a macro like this <b>&#94;r("Print Me!");</b>.
<p>

By default, when this link is clicked, the current page's style is replaced with the "Make Page Printable" style in the Style Manager. However, that can be overridden by specifying the name of another style as the second parameter, like this: &#94;r("Print!","WebGUI");
<p>

<b>NOTES:</b> You can also use the special case &#94;r(linkonly); to return only the URL to the make printable page and nothing more. Also, the .makePrintableLink style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>

<b>&#94;RootTitle;</b><br>
Returns the title of the root of the current page. For instance, the main root in WebGUI is the "Home" page. Many advanced sites have many roots and thus need a way to display to the user which root they are in.
<p>

<b>&#94;u; - Company URL</b><br>
The URL for your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>



<b>&#94;Spacer();</b><br>
Create a spacer in your layout. Great for creating blocks of color with divs and tables. It takes two parameters, width and height.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Spacer("100","50");
<p>

	607 => q|<b>Anonymous Registration</b><br>
Do you wish visitors to your site to be able to register themselves?
<br><br>

<b>Run On Registration</b><br>
If there is a command line specified here, it will be executed each time a user registers anonymously.
<p>

<b>Enable Karma?</b><br>
Should karma be enabled?
<p>

<b>Karma Per Login</b><br>
The amount of karma a user should be given when they log in. This only takes affect if karma is enabled.
<p>

<b>Session Timeout</b><br>
The amount of time that a user session remains active (before needing to log in again). This timeout is reset each time a user views a page. Therefore if you set the timeout for 8 hours, a user would have to log in again if s/he hadn't visited the site for 8 hours.
<p>

<b>Allow users to deactivate their account?</b><br>
Do you wish to provide your users with a means to deactivate their account without your intervention?
<p>

<b>Authentication Method (default)</b><br>
What should the default authentication method be for new accounts that are created? The two available options are WebGUI and LDAP. WebGUI authentication means that the users will authenticate against the username and password stored in the WebGUI database. LDAP authentication means that users will authenticate against an external LDAP server.
<br><br>

<i>NOTE:</i> Authentication settings can be customized on a per user basis.



<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Depending upon what authentication modules you have installed in your system you'll see any number of options after this point. The following are the options for the two defaultly installed authentication methods.
<p>

<b>Encrypt Login?</b><br>
Should the system use the https protocol for the login form?  Note that setting this option to true will only encrypt the authentication itself, not anything else before or after the authentication.
<p>

<h2>WebGUI Authentication Options</h2>

<b>Minimum Password Length</b><br>
Set the minimum length that passwords can be.  If set to 0, there is no minimum length.
<br><br>

<b>Password Timeout</b><br>
Set how long before a user's password expires and has to change it.
<br><br>

<b>Expire passwords on user creation?</b><br>
Should a user's password be expired when he is created by an administrator forcing a change?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Username?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their usernames?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Password?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their passwords?
<br><br>

<b>Send welcome message?</b><br>
Do you wish WebGUI to automatically send users a welcome message when they register for your site?

<h2>LDAP Authentication Options</h2>

<b>LDAP URL (default)</b><br>
The default url to your LDAP server. The LDAP URL takes the form of <b>ldap://[server]:[port]/[base DN]</b>. Example: ldap://ldap.mycompany.com:389/o=MyCompany.
<br><br>




<b>LDAP Identity</b><br>
The LDAP Identity is the unique identifier in the LDAP server that the user will be identified against. Often this field is <b>shortname</b>, which takes the form of first initial + last name. Example: jdoe. Therefore if you specify the LDAP identity to be <i>shortname</i> then Jon Doe would enter <i>jdoe</i> during the registration process.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Identity Name</b><br>
The label used to describe the LDAP Identity to the user. For instance, some companies use an LDAP server for their proxy server users to authenticate against. In the documentation or training already provided to their users, the LDAP identity is known as their <i>Web Username</i></b><i>. So you could enter that label here for consitency.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Password Name</b><br>
Just as the LDAP Identity Name is a label, so is the LDAP Password Name. Use this label as you would LDAP Identity Name.

Information specific about the company or individual who controls this installation of WebGUI.
<p>


<b>Edit Content Settings</b><br>
Settings related to content and content management.
<p>

	615 => q|Groups are used to subdivide privileges and responsibilities within the WebGUI system. For instance, you may be building a site for a classroom situation. In that case you might set up a different group for each class that you teach. You would then apply those groups to the pages that are designed for each class.
<p>

There are several groups built into WebGUI. They are as follows:
<p>

<b>Admins</b><br>
Admins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.
<p>

<b>Content Managers</b><br>
Content managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.
<p>

<b>Everyone</b><br>
Everyone is a magic group in that no one is ever physically inserted into it, but yet all members of the site are part of it. If you want to open up your site to both visitors and registered users, use this group to do it.
<p>

<b>Package Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to add, edit, and delete packages of wobjects and pages to deploy.
<p>

<b>Registered Users</b><br>
When users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.
<p>

<b>Style Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit styles for this site. These privileges do not allow the user to assign privileges to a page, just define them to be used.
<p>

<b>Template Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit templates for this site.
<p>

<b>Visitors</b><br>
Visitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system. Also, if you wish to punish a registered user you could remove him/her from the Registered Users group and insert him/her into the Visitors group.
<p>
|,

	613 => q|Users are the accounts in the system that are given rights to do certain things. There are two default users built into the system: Admin and Visitor.
</i></p><p><i>

<b>Admin</b><br>
Admin is exactly what you'd expect. It is a user with unlimited rights in the WebGUI environment. If it can be done, this user has the rights to do it.
</i></p><p><i>

<b>Visitor</b><br>
Visitor is exactly the opposite of Admin. Visitor has no rights what-so-ever. By default any user who is not logged in is seen as the user Visitor.
</i></p><p><i>

<b>Add a new user.</b><br>
Click on this to go to the add user screen.
</i></p><p><i>

<b>Search</b><br>
You can search users based on username and email address. You can do partial searches too if you like.|,

	612 => q|There is no need to ever actually delete a user. If you are concerned with locking out a user, then simply change their password. If you truely wish to delete a user, then please keep in mind that there are consequences. If you delete a user any content that they added to the site via wobjects (like message boards and user contributions) will remain on the site. However, if another user tries to visit the deleted user's profile they will get an error message. Also if the user ever is welcomed back to the site, there is no way to give him/her access to his/her old content items except by re-adding the user to the users table manually.
<p>


As with any delete operation, you are prompted to be sure you wish to proceed with the delete. If you answer yes, the delete will proceed and there is no recovery possible. If you answer no you'll be returned to the prior screen.

|,

	610 => q|See <b>Manage Users</b> for additional details.
<p>

<b>Username</b><br>
Username is a unique identifier for a user. Sometimes called a handle, it is also how the user will be known on the site. (<i>Note:</i> Administrators have unlimited power in the WebGUI system. This also means they are capable of breaking the system. If you rename or create a user, be careful not to use a username already in existance.)
<p>


<b>Password</b><br>
A password is used to ensure that the user is who s/he says s/he is.

<p>


<b>LDAP URL</b><br>
See <i>Edit Settings</i> for details.
<p>


<b>Connect DN</b><br>
The Connect DN is the <b>cn</b> (or common name) of a given user in your LDAP database. It should be specified as <b>cn=John Doe</b>. This is, in effect, the username that will be used to authenticate this user against your LDAP server.
<p>

	608 => q|Deleting a page can create a big mess if you are uncertain about what you are doing. When you delete a page you are also deleting the content it contains, all sub-pages connected to this page, and all the content they contain. Be certain that you have already moved all the content you wish to keep before you delete a page.
<p>

As with any delete operation, you are prompted to be sure you wish to proceed with the delete. If you answer yes, the delete will proceed and there is no recovery possible. If you answer no you'll be returned to the prior screen.
<p>
|,

	606 => q|Think of pages as containers for content. For instance, if you want to write a letter to the editor of your favorite magazine you'd get out a notepad (or open a word processor) and start filling it with your thoughts. The same is true with WebGUI. Create a page, then add your content to the page.
<p>

<b>Title</b><br>
The title of the page is what your users will use to navigate through the site. Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.
<p>


<b>Menu Title</b><br>
A shorter or altered title to appear in navigation. If left blank this will default to <i>Title</i>.
<p>

<b>Page URL</b><br>
When you create a page a URL for the page is generated based on the page title. If you are unhappy with the URL that was chosen, you can change it here.
<p>

<b>Redirect URL</b><br>
When this page is visited, the user will be redirected to the URL specified here. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The redirects will be disabled while in admin mode in order to make it easier to edit the properties of the page.
<p>


<b>Hide from navigation?</b><br>
Select yes to hide this page from the navigation menus and site maps.
<p>
<B>NOTE:</b> This will not hide the page from the page tree (Administrative functions... &gt; Manage page tree.), only from navigation macros and from site maps.
<p>

<b>Open in new window?</b><br>
Select yes to open this page in a new window. This is often used in conjunction with the <b>Redirect URL</b> parameter.
<p>



<b>Language</b><br/>
Choose the default language for this page. All WebGUI generated messages will appear in that language and the character set will be changed to the character set for that language.
<p/>

<P><B>Cache Timeout</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for registered users. 

<P><B>Cache Timeout (Visitors)</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for visitors. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Page caching is only available if your administrator has installed the Cache::FileCache Perl module. Using page caching can improve site performance by as much as 1000%.&nbsp;


<b>Template</b><br>
By default, WebGUI has one big content area to place wobjects. However, by specifying a template other than the default you can sub-divide the content area into several sections.
<p>

<b>Synopsis</b><br>
A short description of a page. It is used to populate default descriptive meta tags as well as to provide descriptions on Site Maps.
<p>

<b>Meta Tags</b><br>
Meta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. You can find a  <a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/mk-metas.html">little utility here</a> that will help you build meta tags if you've never done it before.
<p>

<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the  area of your pages, you may put them here as well.
<p>

<b>Use default meta tags?</b><br>
If you don't wish to specify meta tags yourself, WebGUI can generate meta tags based on the page title and your company's name. Check this box to enable the WebGUI-generated meta tags.
<p>


<b>Style</b><br>
By default, when you create a page, it inherits a few traits from its parent. One of those traits is style. Choose from the list of styles if you would like to change the appearance of this page. See <i>Add Style</i> for more details.
<p>

If you select "Yes" below the style pull-down menu, all of the pages below this page will take on the style you've chosen for this page.
<p>

<b>Start Date</b><br>
The date when users may begin viewing this page. Note that before this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>

<b>End Date</b><br>
The date when users will stop viewing this page. Note that after this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>


<b>Owner</b><br>
The owner of a page is usually the person who created the page. This user always has full edit and viewing rights on the page.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The owner can only be changed by an administrator.
<p>


<b>Who can view?</b><br>
Choose which group can view this page. If you want both visitors and registered users to be able to view the page then you should choose the "Everybody" group.
<p>

<b>Who can edit?</b><br>
Choose the group that can edit this page. The group assigned editing rights can also always view the page.
<p>

You can optionally recursively give these privileges to all pages under this page.
<p>

<b>What next?</b><br/>
If you leave this on the default setting you'll be redirected to the new page after creating it.
<p/>|,

	875 => q|A new message has been posted to one of your subscriptions.|,

	638 => q|Templates are used to affect how content is laid out in WebGUI. There are many templates that come with WebGUI, and using the template management system, you can add your own templates to the system to ensure that your site looks <b>exactly</b> how you want it to look. 
|,

	639 => q|<b>Template Name</b><br/>
Give this template a descriptive name so that you'll know what it is when you're applying a template to content.
<p/>

<b>Namespace</b><br/>
What type of template is this?
<p/>

<b>Template</b><br/>
Create your template by using template commands and variables, macros, and HTML.
<p/>

<b>NOTE:</b> You should never edit the default templates that come with WebGUI as they are subject to change with each new release. Instead, copy the template you wish to edit, and edit the copy.|,

	640 => q|It is not a good idea to delete templates as you never know what kind of adverse affect it may have on your site (some content may still be using the template). 
<p>

|,

	624 => q|WebGUI macros are used to create dynamic content within otherwise static content. For instance, you may wish to show which user is logged in on every page, or you may wish to have a dynamically built menu or crumb trail. 
<p>

Macros always begin with a carat (&#94;) and follow with at least one other character and ended with a semicolon (;). Some macros can be extended/configured by taking the format of &#94;<i>x</i>("<b>config text</b>");. 
<p>

NOTE: The following macros are reserved for system/wobject-specific functions as in the SQL Report wobject and the Body in the Style Manager: 
<b>&#94;-;,&#94;0;,&#94;1;,&#94;2;,&#94;3;, etc.</b><br>

	845 => q|Style Macros|,

	843 => q|User Macros|,

	844 => q|These macros have to do with users and logins.
<p/>

<b>&#94;a; or &#94;a(); - My Account Link</b><br>
A link to your account information. In addition you can change the link text by creating a macro like this <b>&#94;a("Account Info");</b>. 
<p>

<b>NOTES:</b> You can also use the special case &#94;a(linkonly); to return only the URL to the account page and nothing more. Also, the .myAccountLink style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>


<b>&#94;AdminText();</b><br>
Displays a small text message to a user who is in admin mode. Example: &#94;AdminText("You are in admin mode!");
<p>

<b>&#94;AdminToggle; or &#94;AdminToggle();</b><br>
Places a link on the page which is only visible to content managers and adminstrators. The link toggles on/off admin mode. You can optionally specify other messages to display like this: &#94;AdminToggle("Edit On","Edit Off");
<p>

<b>&#94;CanEditText();</b><br>
Display a message to a user that can edit the current page.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;CanEditText(^AdminToggle;);
<p>

<b>&#94;EditableToggle; or &#94;EditableToggle();</b><br>
Exactly the same as AdminToggle, except that the toggle is only displayed if the user has the rights to edit the current page.
<p>

<b>&#94;GroupAdd();</b><br>
Using this macro you can allow users to add themselves to a group. The first parameter is the name of the group this user should be added to. The second parameter is a text string for the user to click on to add themselves to this group.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If the user is not logged in, or or already belongs to the group, or the group is not set to allow auto adds, then no link will be displayed.
<p>


<b>&#94;GroupDelete();</b><br>
Using this macro you can allow users to delete themselves from a group. The first parameter is the name of the group this user should be deleted from. The second parameter is a text string for the user to click on to delete themselves from this group.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If the user is not logged in or the user does not belong to the group, or the group is not set to allow auto deletes, then no link will be displayed.
<p>

<b>&#94;GroupText();</b><br>
Displays a small text message to the user if they belong to the specified group. And you can specify an alternate message to those who are not in the group.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;GroupText("Visitors","You need an account to do anything cool on this site!","We value our registered users!");
<p>

<b>&#94;L; or &#94;L(); - Login Box</b><br>
A small login form. You can also configure this macro. You can set the width of the login box like this &#94;L(20);. You can also set the message displayed after the user is logged in like this &#94;L(20,Hi &#94;a(&#94;@;);. Click %here% if you wanna log out!)
<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> The .loginBox style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>

<b>&#94;LoginToggle; or &#94;LoginToggle();</b><br>
Displays a "Login" or "Logout" message depending upon whether the user is logged in or not. You can optionally specify other labels like this: &#94;LoginToggle("Click here to log in.","Click here to log out.");. You can also use the special case &#94;LoginToggle(linkonly); to return only the URL with no label.
<p>

<b>&#94;@; - Username</b><br>
The username of the currently logged in user.
<p>


<b>&#94;#; - User ID</b><br>
The user id of the currently logged in user.

	837 => q|Folder, Add/Edit|,

	838 => q|Folders are used to organize collateral, much the same way you'd use folders on your hard drive or in a file cabinet.
<p/>
<b>Organize in Folder</b><br/>
Folders can be inside of other folders. In which folder would you like to put this folder?
<p/>

<b>Name</b><br/>
Give this folder a name so you can recognize what's in it.
<p/>

<b>Description</b><br/>
Describe the folder so that you remember why you created it and what it's supposed to contain.
<p/>|,

	835 => q|Snippet, Add/Edit|,

	836 => q|Snippets are bits of text that may be reused on your site. Thinks like java scripts, style sheets, flash animations, or even slogans are all great snippets. Best of all, if you need to change the text, you can change it in only one location.
<p/>
<b>Name</b><br/>
Give your snippet a unqiue name that you can use later to retrieve it.
<p/>

<b>Organize in Folder</b><br/>
Which collateral folder should contain this snippet?
<p/>

<b>Snippet</b><br/>
Start typing! Or better yet, copy the snippet from some other electronic document and paste it here.
<p/>|,

	833 => q|File, Add/Edit|,

	834 => q|You can upload any kind of file to the repository to be used later.
<p/>

<b>Name</b><br/>
Give this file a unique name that you can use to retrieve it later.
<p/>

<b>Organize in Folder</b><br/>
Which collateral folder should hold this file?
<p/>

<b>File</b><br/>
Select a file from your hard drive to upload.
<p/>|,

	831 => q|Collateral Macros|,

	829 => q|Page Template|,

	830 => q|Page templates are used to organize wobjects on your page. To do this you create page template positions. You can have any number of positions in your page template, but you must always have position one. The following are the variables available to page templates.
<p>

<b>position<i>X</i>_loop</b><br>
The loop that defines a page position and contains a list of wobjects for that position. Replace <i>X</i> with a number, so position one would be <i>position1_loop</i>, and position two would be <i>position2_loop</i>, etc.
<blockquote>

<b>wobject.canView</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to view this wobject. 
<p>

<b>wobject.canEdit</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to edit this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.controls</b><br>
The toolbar for manipulating the properties of this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.namespace</b><br>
The namespace of this wobject. This is also known as the wobject type, for instance Article, USS, SQLReport, and SiteMap are all namespaces.
<p>

<b>wobject.id</b><br>
The unique identifier for this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.isInDateRange</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the wobject is scheduled to be displayed right now. The variable <i>wobject.canView</i> already takes this into account, but content managers can always view content, so this is an extra check so they don't have to see the wobject if it's not scheduled to appear yet, or if it's end date has already passed.
<p>

<b>wobject.content</b><br>
The content produced by the wobject.
<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The position elements can go up to 1 billion, which should be more than enough for the average site.

<p>

<b>page.canEdit</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to edit this page.
<p>

<b>page.controls</b><br>
The toolbar for manipulating the properties of the page.
<p>

	825 => q|Template, Language|,

	826 => q|WebGUI has a powerful templating language built to give you maximum control over the layout of your content. The following is a list of the template language syntax.

<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b> Please note that the words <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i> are used below as placeholders for the actual variable names that you'll use. They are not part of the template language.

<p/>
<b>Variables</b><br/>
Variables are the most basic of the template commands. They are used to position pieces of content.

<p/>
<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_var foo&gt; or &lt;tmpl_var name="foo"&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> &lt;tmpl_var name&gt;
<p/>

<b>Conditions</b><br/>
To programmers conditions are nothing new, but to designers they can often be confusing at first. Conditions are really just true or false questions, and if you think of them that way, you'll have no trouble at all.
<p/>

<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_if foo&gt; &lt;tmpl_else&gt; &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;
<br/>
<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_unless foo&gt; &lt;tmpl_else&gt; &lt;/tmpl_unless&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> &lt;tmpl_if isTrue&gt; It was true!&lt;tmpl_else&gt; It was false! &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;
<p/>

<b>Loops</b><br/>
Loops iterate over a list of data output for each pass in the loop. Loops are slightly more complicated to use than plain variables, but are considerably more powerful.
<p/>

<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_loop foo&gt; &lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> <br/>
&lt;tmpl_loop users&gt; <br/>
  &nbsp; Name: &lt;tmpl_var first_name&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>
&lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
<p/>

<b>Loop Conditions</b><br/>
Loops come with special condition variables of their own. They are __FIRST__, __ODD__, __INNER__, and __LAST__.
<p/>

<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<pre>
   &lt;TMPL_LOOP FOO&gt;
      &lt;TMPL_IF __FIRST__&gt;
        This only outputs on the first pass.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __ODD__&gt;
        This outputs every other pass, on the odd passes.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_UNLESS __ODD__&gt;
        This outputs every other pass, on the even passes.
      &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __INNER__&gt;
        This outputs on passes that are neither first nor last.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __LAST__&gt;
        This only outputs on the last pass.
      &lt;TMPL_IF&gt;
   &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;
</pre>

<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b>Both the template language and template variables are case-insensitive.|,

	827 => q|Wobject Template|,

	828 => q|Most wobjects have templates that allow you to change the layout of the wobject's user interface. Those wobjects that do have templates all have a common set of template variables that you can use for layout, as well as their own custom variables. The following is a list of the common template variables shared among all wobjects.
<p/>
<b>title</b><br/>
The title for this wobject.
<p/>

<b>displayTitle</b><br/>
A conditional variable for whether or not the title should be displayed.
<p/>

<b>description</b><br/>
The description of this wobject.
<p/>

<b>wobjectId</b><br/>
The unique identifier that WebGUI uses to control this wobject.
<p/>

<b>isShortcut</b><br />
A conditional indicating if this wobject is a shortcut to an original wobject.
<p />

<b>originalURL</b><br />
If this wobject is a shortcut, then this URL will direct you to the original wobject.

	889 => q|Style Sheets, Tabs|,

	890 => q|WebGUI has a sub-system that can create tabs. You'll see these in complex forms such as page editing. In order to make the tabs system look good and match your site, you'll need to add a section to your style's style sheet specifically for the tabs. 
<p>
The following style sheet classes are available:
<p>

<b>.tab</b><br>
The default look of each tab.
<p>

<b>div.tabs</b><br>
This also sets some properties for all of the tabs. This should be used for the text labels in the tabs.
<p>


<b>.tabBody</b><br>
The content area for each tab. This is where the form will show up. Note that for best results the background color of this should match the background color of .tabActive.
<p>


<b>.tabHover</b><br>
The look of a tab as the mouse hovers over it.
<p>

<b>.tabActive</b><br>
The look of the tab that is currently visible.
<p>



<i>Examples</i><br>
You can use these instead of creating your own if you wish. Or just use these as guidelines for creating your own.
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td valign="top">

	840 => q|These macros are designed to provide programming-like functionality. They are powerful when used appropriately, and dangerous when used carelessly. Take care when using these macros.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> These macros are included in WebGUI in order to provide very powerful display mechanisms. Though they could be used to write simple web applications, this is not their intended use, nor is it supported or condoned by Plain Black. If you find yourself trying to do something like that, just write a macro. =) <b>By default these macros are disabled to protect the security of your site and server, and only your administrator can enable them.</b>

<p/>

<b>&#94;D; or &#94;D(); - Date</b><br>
The current date and time.
<p>

You can configure the date by using date formatting symbols. For instance, if you created a macro like this <b>&#94;D("%c %D, %y");</b> it would output <b>September 26, 2001</b>. The following are the available date formatting symbols:
<p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>%%</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>%y</td><td>4 digit year</td></tr><tr><td>%Y</td><td>2 digit year</td></tr><tr><td>%m</td><td>2 digit month</td></tr><tr><td>%M</td><td>variable digit month</td></tr><tr><td>%c</td><td>month name</td></tr><tr><td>%d</td><td>2 digit day of month</td></tr><tr><td>%D</td><td>variable digit day of month</td></tr><tr><td>%w</td><td>day of week name</td></tr><tr><td>%h</td><td>2 digit base 12 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%H</td><td>variable digit base 12 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%j</td><td>2 digit base 24 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%J</td><td>variable digit base 24 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%p</td><td>lower case am/pm</td></tr><tr><td>%P</td><td>upper case AM/PM</td></tr><tr><td>%z</td><td>user preference date format</td></tr><tr><td>%Z</td><td>user preference time format</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>

<b>&#94;Env()</b><br>
Can be used to display a web server environment variable on a page. The environment variables available on each server are different, but you can find out which ones your web server has by going to: http://www.yourwebguisite.com/env.pl
<p>

The macro should be specified like this &#94;Env("REMOTE_ADDR");
<p>

<b>&#94;Execute();</b><br>
Allows a content manager or administrator to execute an external program. Takes the format of <b>&#94;Execute("/this/file.sh");</b>.
<p>


<b>&#94;FormParam();</b><br>
This macro is mainly used in generating dynamic queries in SQL Reports. Using this macro you can pull the value of any form field simply by specifing the name of the form field, like this: &#94;FormParam("phoneNumber");
<p>


<b>&#94;If();</b><br>
A simple conditional statement (IF/THEN/ELSE) to control layout and messages.
<p>
<i>Examples:</i><br>
Display Happy New Year on 1st January:
      &#94;If('&#94;D("%m%d");' eq '0101' , Happy New Year);
<p>
Display a message to people on your subnet (192.168.1.*):<br>
&#94;If('&#94;Env("REMOTE_ADDR");' =~ /&#94;192.168.1/,"Hi co-worker","Hi Stranger");
<p>
Display a message to Windows users:<br>
      &#94;If('&#94;URLEncode("&#94;Env("HTTP_USER_AGENT");");' =~ /windows/i,"Hey... Linux is free !");
<p>
Display a message if a user is behind a proxy:<br>
      &#94;If('&#94;Env("HTTP_VIA");' ne "", You're behind a proxy !, Proxy-free is the best...);
<p>
Display Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening:<br>
      &#94;If(&#94;D("%J");<=12,Good Morning,&#94;If(&#94;D("%J");<=18,Good Afternoon,Good evening););
<p>

<b>&#94;Include();</b><br>
Allows a content manager or administrator to include a file from the local filesystem. 
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Include("/this/file.html");
<p>

<b>&#94;International();</b><br/>
Pull a translated message from the internationalization system.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;International(45,"Article");
<p/>


<b>&#94;Quote();</b><br>
Use this to escape a string before using it in a database query.
<p>


<b>&#94;Page();</b><br>
This can be used to retrieve information about the current page. For instance it could be used to get the page URL like this &#94;Page("urlizedTitle"); or to get the menu title like this &#94;Page("menuTitle");.
<p>

<b>&#94;SQL();</b><br>
A one line SQL report. Sometimes you just need to pull something back from the database quickly. This macro is also useful in extending the SQL Report wobject. It uses the numeric macros (&#94;0; &#94;1; &#94;2; etc) to position data and can also use the ^rownum; macro just like the SQL Report wobject. Examples:<p>
 &#94;SQL("select count(*) from users","There are &#94;0; users on this system.");
<p>
&#94;SQL("select userId,username from users order by username","&lt;a href='^/;?op=viewProfile&uid=&#94;0;'&gt;^1;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;");
<p>
<b>&#94;URLEncode();</b><br>
This macro is mainly useful in SQL reports, but it could be useful elsewhere as well. It takes the input of a string and URL Encodes it so that the string can be passed through a URL. It's syntax looks like this: &#94;URLEncode("Is this my string?");
<p>


<b>&#94;User();</b><br>
This macro will allow you to display any information from a user's account or profile. For instance, if you wanted to display a user's email address you'd create this macro: &#94;User("email");
<p>

<b>&#94;*; or &#94;*(); - Random Number</b><br>
A randomly generated number. This is often used on images (such as banner ads) that you want to ensure do not cache. In addition, you may configure this macro like this <b>&#94;*(100);</b> to create a random number between 0 and 100.
<p>

<b>&#94;-;,&#94;0;,&#94;1;,&#94;2;,&#94;3;, etc.</b><br>
These macros are reserved for system/wobject-specific functions as in the SQL Report wobject and the Body in the Style Manager.

	932 => q|Themes are a mechanism to quickly install new styles, templates, and collateral into a WebGUI site. They are also great for moving those same items from one site to another.
<p>
<b>TIP:</b> When building a theme, be sure to name the components (styles, templates collateral) in the theme with some name that is unique to the theme. This is useful so that your users can find the components in your theme, as well as to avoid name conflicts.|,

	938 => q|Theme, Delete|,

	939 => q|When you delete a theme you've created all you're actually deleting is the basic properties for the theme. However, when you delete a theme you've imported, you'll also be deleting all of its components (styles, templates, and collateral) as well. Be careful that you are no longer using any of those components before deleting them.|,

	936 => q|Theme, Import|,

	937 => q|In order to import a theme you need a valid theme file exported from another WebGUI site. Just select the theme from your hard drive and click the "Import" button. You'll then get a confirmation screen asking whether this is the theme you wanted to import. If you agree, click on the "Import" button again and you'll have your new theme. You can then start to apply the theme to your site as you would any normal style, template, or collateral data.
<p>
You cannot import a theme twice. If you wish to import a new version of a theme, then you must first delete the previous version of the theme. 
<p>
You also cannot import a theme from a version of WebGUI that is newer than the one you're using. Therefore if you are using WebGUI 5.2.4 and a theme was created with WebGUI 6.0.0, then you will not be allowed to import the theme until you upgrade.
|,

	935 => q|The file you uploaded does not appear to be a valid theme file.|,

	933 => q|Theme, Edit|,

	934 => q|Creating and editing themes is a fairly simple process. First you set up some basic properties for the theme, and then you start adding components to the theme. 
<p>
The basic properties of a theme cannot be changed by anyone except the site that the theme was created on. The following are the definitions of the basic properties of a theme:
<p>
<b>Theme ID</b><br>
The unique ID for this theme within this WebGUI site. This ID will change if this theme is imported into another site.
<p>

<b>Theme Name</b><br>
This is the unique name of the theme. It must be unique in every site that the theme will be imported into. This name will not change across sites.
<p>

<b>Theme Designer</b><br>
The name of the person or company that created this theme. 
<p>

<b>Designer URL</b><br>
The URL of the web site for this theme's designer. If you are in the business of creating themes for WebGUI, then this is your place to attract attention to your offerings.

	940 => q|Open in new window?|,

	832 => q|The collateral management system has several macros for its specific purpose.
<p/>

<b>&#94;File();</b><br/>
This macro builds a quick file link. It creates an icon for the file and outputs the files name. Then it links them both to the file for downloading.
<p/>

<b>&#94;I();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves an image from the collateral management system along with an HTML image tag so that you can quickly display an image from the repository in your content.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;I("logo");
<p/>

<b>&#94;i();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves the URL for any file in the collateral management system.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;i("status report");
<p/>


<b>&#94;RandomImage();</b><br/>
This macro takes a collateral folder as a parameter. If the folder name is omitted, then the root folder will be used. The macro then randomly chooses an image in the folder and returns it in much the same way the &#94;I(); macro works.
<p />
<i>Example:</i> &#94;RandomImage("site headers");
<p />

<b>&#94;RandomSnippet();</b><br/>
This macro takes a collateral folder as a parameter. If the folder name is omitted, then the root folder will be used. The macro then randomly chooses a snippet from the folder and returns it in much the same way the &#94;Snippet(); macro works.
<p />
<i>Example:</i> &#94;RandomSnippet("quips");
<p />


<b>&#94;SI();</b><br/>
The Scaled Image macro allows images to be found in the collateral and scaled (on the server-side), either maintaining the original aspect ratio or an entirely new ratio of your design. 
<p>
It takes four parameters. The first is the image name or optionally the collateral id. The second is the width. Set the width to "0" to maintain aspect ratio by height. The third is height. Set the height to "0" to maintain aspect ratio by width. The fourth parameter allows you to specify additional parameters to the image.
<p />
<i>Examples:</i><br>
Retrieving an image by name (no scaling)<br>
^SI(myimage);
<p>
Retrieving an image by collateralId (no scaling)<br>
^SI(66);
<p>
Scaling by width, maintaining aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,25);
<p>
Scaling by height, maintaining aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,0,25);
<p>
Playing with the aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,148,25);
<p>
Using parameters<br>
^SI(66,0,0,'border="0"');
<p />


<b>&#94;Snippet();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves the contents of a snippet in the collateral management system and inserts it into the page.
<p />
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Snippet("flash code");
<p />

<b>&#94;Thumbnail();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves the URL for the thumbnail of any image in the collateral management system.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Thumbnail("logo");
<p/>

<b>&#94;ThumbnailLinker();</b><br/>
This macro builds a quick image viewer using nothing more than the collateral management system. It creates a thumbnail image with the name of the image under it and then links them both to the full sized image. You can also specify a "1" as a second parameter to have the linker create a new window to display the linked image.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;ThumbnailLinker("logo");
<p/>

	622 => q|See <i>Manage Group</i> for a description of grouping functions and the default groups.
<p>

<b>Group Name</b><br>
A name for the group. It is best if the name is descriptive so you know what it is at a glance.
<p>

<b>Description</b><br>
A longer description of the group so that other admins and content managers (or you if you forget) will know what the purpose of this group is.
<p>

<b>Expire Offset</b><br>
The amount of time that a user will belong to this group before s/he is expired (or removed) from it. This is very useful for membership sites where users have certain privileges for a specific period of time. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This can be overridden on a per-user basis.
<p>

<b>Notify user about expiration?</b><br>
Set this value to yes if you want WebGUI to contact the user when they are about to be expired from the group.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the notification. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the notification to be sent on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the notification to go out 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the notification to be sent 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Message</b><br>
Type the message you wish to be sent to the user telling them about the expiration.
<p>

<b>Delete Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the grouping being deleted from the system. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the grouping to be deleted on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the grouping to be deleted 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the grouping to be deleted 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Scratch Filter</b><br>
A user can be dynamically bound to a group by a scratch variable in their session. Scratch variables can be set programatically, or via the web. To set a scratch variable via the web, tack the following on to the end of any URL:
<p>
<i>?op=setScratch&scratchName=somename&scratchValue=somevalue</i>
<p>
Having done that, when a user clicks on that link they will have a scratch variable added to their session with a name of "www_somename" and a value of "somevalue". The "www_" is prepended to prevent web requests from overwriting scratch variables that were set programatically.
<p>
To set a scratch filter simply add a line to the scratch filter field that looks like:
<p>
<i>www_somename=somevalue</i>
<p>

<b>IP Address</b><br>
Specify an IP address or an IP mask to match. If the user's IP address matches, they'll automatically be included in this group. An IP mask is simply the IP address minus an octet or two. You may also specify multiple IP masks separated by semicolons.
<p>
<i>IP Mask Example:</i> 10.;192.168.;101.42.200.142
<p>

<b>Karma Threshold</b><br>
If you've enabled Karma, then you'll be able to set this value. Karma Threshold is the amount of karma a user must have to be considered part of this group.
<p>


<b>Users can add themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users add themselves to this group? See the GroupAdd macro for more info.
<p>

<b>Users can remove themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users remove themselves from this group? See the GroupDelete macro for more info.
<p>

<i>The following options are recommended only for advanced WebGUI administrators.</i>
<p>

<b>Database Link</b><br>
If you'd like to have this group validate users using an external database, choose the database link to use.
<p>

<b>SQL Query</b><br>
Many organizations have external databases that map users to groups; for example an HR database might map Employee ID to Health Care Plan.  To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with "select 1".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user's profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional profile field called employeeId.<br>
<br>
select 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>
where employees.employee_id = ^User("employeeId");<br>
and health_plans.plan_name = 'HMO 1'<br>
and employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>
and health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>
<br>
This group could then be named "Employees in HMO 1", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.
<p>

<b>Cache external groups for how long?</b><br>
Large sites using external group data will be making many calls to the external database.  To help reduce the load, you may select how long you'd like to cache the results of the external database query within the WebGUI database.  More advanced background caching may be included in a future version of WebGUI.|,

	1073 => q|Style Template|,

	1074 => q|Style templates are a special kind of template in WebGUI. They allow you to keep your content seperated from the look and feel of your site. The following are the template variables available in style templates:

<p>

<b>body.content</b><br>
The the content on the current page.
<p>

<b>head.tags</b><br>
Tags that WebGUI automatically generates for you so that caching works the way it should, search engines can find you better, and other useful automated functionality. This should go in the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; section of your style.

<p>
In addition to the above tags all of the session variables are made available to you just like any other template. We suggest using something like this in the &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; portion of your style:
<p>

&lt;tmpl_var session.page.title&gt; - &lt;tmpl_var session.setting.companyName&gt;

<p>
Following a guide like the above will help you get good ranking on search engines.

	1098 => q|Navigation, Add/Edit|,

	1093 => q|<P>Edit Navigation lets you add and edit what are essentially 'menu templates' -- they define what pages' Menu Names should be included in a menu based (sometimes) on where that menu appears. </P>
<P><B>Identifier</B><BR>This is the (unique) label you will later use to specify this Navigation definition in a ^Navigation(); macro.</P>
<P><B>Base Page<BR></B>This identifies the spot in the Page Tree where the macro should commence listing pages. The first three choices will create 'absolute' menus -- ones which will display the same pages no matter which page you use the macro from. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The next four create 'relative' menus -- ones in which the items which will be displayed depend on the location in the page tree of the page in which you use the macro.</P>
<P>Use the&nbsp;'Add new value' option if you want to specify a custom starting page. You can refer&nbsp;to a&nbsp;starting page by its urlized title or its pageId.</P>
<P><B>Return a Loop With</B><BR>This determines which pages relative to the base page will be included in the menu which the macro creates.</P>
<UL>
<LI>daughters - pages below the&nbsp;base&nbsp;page 
<LI>sisters - pages at the same level as the&nbsp;base page, excluding the base page itself. 
<LI>self and sisters - all pages at the same level as the base page. 
<LI>descendants - all the descendants of base page (daughters, granddaughters, grand-granddaughters, etc) 
<LI>self and descendants - base page and all of it's descendants. 
<LI>childless descendants - The "leaf nodes" under base page. Also called "terminal nodes" -- i.e. pages that have no daughters. 
<LI>generation - base page, it's sisters, it's cousins, grand cousins, grand-grand cousins, etc. Technically spoken: Pages that share the same depth as "base page". 
<LI>ancestors - all base page ancestors, starting with it's mother, then grandmother, etc, up to the root page. 
<LI>self and ancestors - same as ancestors but starting at base page. 
<LI>pedigree - This is what we know as the "FlexMenu". Starting at base page, it returns its daughters, self and sisters, ancestors and the sisters of each ancestor.<BR></LI></UL>
<P><B>Stop traversing when reaching level</B><BR>This allows you to prune a menu -- in either direction -- when it reaches a <I>specific</I> level in the page tree. It's slightly different in effect than... </P>
<P><B>Max Depth</B><BR>...which allows you to prune a menu -- in either direction -- when it reaches a <I>number of levels</I> in the page tree. 'Stop Traversing' is absolute; 'Max Depth' is relative. Presumably, if you set both, whichever one takes effect <I>first</I> will be the active limit (that is, they're OR'd together). </P>
<P><B>Show System Pages</B><BR>Should the menus the macro creates include System pages? <BR>System pages: Trash, clipboard, page not found, etc.</P>
<P><B>Show Hidden Pages</B><BR>Should the menus the macro creates include pages which are marked as Hidden? </P>
<P><B>Show Unpriviliged Pages</B><BR>Should the menus the macro creates include pages which the currently logged-in user does not have the privilige to view? </P>
<P><B>Template</B><BR>This menu permits you to select a template which is used to style the output created by the macro -- if you need the same collection of pages in multiple formats, you'll need to create multiple Navigation entries with (slightly) different names; the Copy Navigation button is useful for this.</P>
<P><B>Revert Output<BR></B>When this option is switched on, the menu will be in reverse order.</P>
<P><STRONG>Preview<BR></STRONG>The Preview button allows you to view a navigation setup without actually saving it.<STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000></P></FONT></STRONG>|,

	1094 => q|Navigation, Manage|,

	1095 => q|<P>The general idea behind the&nbsp;navigation system is that instead of<BR>hardwiring all the various choices you might make into the code, the<BR>system manages a 'library' of these styles, just the way it does with<BR>Snippets, Images, Templates, Page Styles, and other types of reusable<BR>information.&nbsp; You can create a new 'nav menu style', give it a name,<BR>and then use it anywhere on your site that you like.</P>
<P>The navigation system consists of two parts:</P>
<OL>
<LI>The navigation editor</LI>
<LI>The <STRONG>^Navigation();</STRONG> macro</LI></OL>
<P>The easiest way to add a completely new menu to your site is to put a <STRONG>^Navigation(myMenu);</STRONG> macro into your style. <BR>A "edit myMenu" link will be displayed if "myMenu" is not defined. </P>
<P>Note: In this example "myMenu" is used, but you can pick any name, as long as it is unique.</P>|,
