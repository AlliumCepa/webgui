<b>If proxied, use real client IP address?</b><br>
If enabled and if the environment variable HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR is present, it's value will be used in place of REMOTE_ADDRESS as the client browser's IP address.

Some companies have proxy servers that cause problems with WebGUI. If you're experiencing problems with WebGUI, and you have a proxy server, you may want to set this setting to <i>Yes</i>. Beware that WebGUI's URLs will not be as user-friendly after this feature is turned on.

WebGUI can track some statistical information for your site. However, this will add a little extra strain on your processor and will make your database grow much more quickly. Enable this only if you do not have an external web statistics program.

<b>Host To Use</b><br>
Select which host to use by default when generating URLs. Config Sitename will use the "sitename" variable from your config file. And Env HTTP Host will use the "HTTP_HOST" environment variable provided by the web server.

<p>


The following is a list of classes used to control the default look of WebGUI. These of course can be overridden or replaced in the various templates that generate them.
<p>


<b>A</b><br>
The links throughout the style.
<p>


<b>BODY</b><br>
The default setup of all pages within a style.
<p>


<b>H1</b><br>
The headers on every page.
<p>


<b>.content</b><br>
The main content area on all pages of the style.
<p>


<b>.formDescription </b><br>
The tags on all forms next to the form elements. 
<p>


<b>.formSubtext </b><br>
The tags below some form elements.
<p>


<b>.highlight </b><br>

<p/>

<b>&#94;AdminBar;</b><br>
Places the administrative tool bar on the page. This is a required element in the "body" segment of the Style Manager. This macro uses a style sheet class called <i>.adminBar </i>, which you may want to account for in your style.

<p>


<b>&#94;c; - Company Name</b><br>
The name of your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>


<b>&#94;e; - Company Email Address</b><br>
The email address for your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>

<b>&#94;Extras;</b><br>
Returns the path to the WebGUI "extras" folder, which contains things like WebGUI icons.
<p>

<b>&#94;LastModified; or &#94;LastModified();</b><br>
Displays the date that the current page was last modified based upon the wobjects on the page. The date is defaultly displayed based upon the user's date preferences. Optionally, it can take two parameters. The first is text to display before the date. The second is a date format string (see the D (date) macro for details.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;LastModified("Updated: ","%c %D, %y");
<p>


<b>&#94;PageTitle;</b><br>
Displays the title of the current page.
<p>

<B>NOTE:</b> If you begin using admin functions or the indepth functions of any wobject, the page title will become a link that will quickly bring you back to the page.
<p>

<b>&#94;r; or &#94;r(); - Make Page Printable</b><br>
Creates a link to remove the style from a page to make it printable.  In addition, you can change the link text by creating a macro like this <b>&#94;r("Print Me!");</b>.
<p>

By default, when this link is clicked, the current page's style is replaced with the "Make Page Printable" style in the Style Manager. However, that can be overridden by specifying the name of another style as the second parameter, like this: &#94;r("Print!","WebGUI");
<p>

<b>NOTES:</b> You can also use the special case &#94;r(linkonly); to return only the URL to the make printable page and nothing more. Also, the .makePrintableLink style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>

<b>&#94;RootTitle;</b><br>
Returns the title of the root of the current page. For instance, the main root in WebGUI is the "Home" page. Many advanced sites have many roots and thus need a way to display to the user which root they are in.
<p>

<b>&#94;u; - Company URL</b><br>
The URL for your company specified in the settings by your Administrator.
<p>



<b>&#94;Spacer();</b><br>
Create a spacer in your layout. Great for creating blocks of color with divs and tables. It takes two parameters, width and height.

<p>

<b>Enable Karma?</b><br>
Should karma be enabled?
<p>

<b>Karma Per Login</b><br>
The amount of karma a user should be given when they log in. This only takes affect if karma is enabled.
<p>

<b>Session Timeout</b><br>
The amount of time that a user session remains active (before needing to log in again). This timeout is reset each time a user views a page. Therefore if you set the timeout for 8 hours, a user would have to log in again if s/he hadn't visited the site for 8 hours.
<p>

<b>Allow users to deactivate their account?</b><br>
Do you wish to provide your users with a means to deactivate their account without your intervention?
<p>

<b>Authentication Method (default)</b><br>
What should the default authentication method be for new accounts that are created? The two available options are WebGUI and LDAP. WebGUI authentication means that the users will authenticate against the username and password stored in the WebGUI database. LDAP authentication means that users will authenticate against an external LDAP server.
<br><br>

<i>NOTE:</i> Authentication settings can be customized on a per user basis.



<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> Depending upon what authentication modules you have installed in your system you'll see any number of options after this point. The following are the options for the two defaultly installed authentication methods.
<p>

<b>Encrypt Login?</b><br>
Should the system use the https protocol for the login form?  Note that setting this option to true will only encrypt the authentication itself, not anything else before or after the authentication.
<p>

<h2>WebGUI Authentication Options</h2>

<b>Minimum Password Length</b><br>
Set the minimum length that passwords can be.  If set to 0, there is no minimum length.
<br><br>

<b>Password Timeout</b><br>
Set how long before a user's password expires and has to change it.
<br><br>

<b>Expire passwords on user creation?</b><br>
Should a user's password be expired when he is created by an administrator forcing a change?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Username?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their usernames?
<br><br>

<b>Allow Users to Change Password?</b><br>
Should users be allowed to change their passwords?
<br><br>

<b>Send welcome message?</b><br>
Do you wish WebGUI to automatically send users a welcome message when they register for your site? 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> In addition to the message you specify below, the user's account information will be included in the message.
<p>

<b>Welcome Message</b> <br>
Type the message that you'd like to be sent to users upon registration.
<p>

<b>Recover Password Message</b><br>
Type a message that will be sent to your users if they try to recover their WebGUI password.
<p>



<h2>LDAP Authentication Options</h2>

<b>LDAP URL (default)</b><br>
The default url to your LDAP server. The LDAP URL takes the form of <b>ldap://[server]:[port]/[base DN]</b>. Example: ldap://ldap.mycompany.com:389/o=MyCompany.
<br><br>




<b>LDAP Identity</b><br>
The LDAP Identity is the unique identifier in the LDAP server that the user will be identified against. Often this field is <b>shortname</b>, which takes the form of first initial + last name. Example: jdoe. Therefore if you specify the LDAP identity to be <i>shortname</i> then Jon Doe would enter <i>jdoe</i> during the registration process.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Identity Name</b><br>
The label used to describe the LDAP Identity to the user. For instance, some companies use an LDAP server for their proxy server users to authenticate against. In the documentation or training already provided to their users, the LDAP identity is known as their <i>Web Username</i></b><i>. So you could enter that label here for consitency.
<br><br>

<b>LDAP Password Name</b><br>
Just as the LDAP Identity Name is a label, so is the LDAP Password Name. Use this label as you would LDAP Identity Name.

In that case you might set up a different group for each class that you teach. You would then apply those groups to the pages that are designed for each class.
<p>

There are several groups built into WebGUI. They are as follows:
<p>

<b>Admins</b><br>
Admins are users who have unlimited privileges within WebGUI. A user should only be added to the admin group if they oversee the system. Usually only one to three people will be added to this group.
<p>

<b>Content Managers</b><br>
Content managers are users who have privileges to add, edit, and delete content from various areas on the site. The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.
<p>

<b>Everyone</b><br>
Everyone is a magic group in that no one is ever physically inserted into it, but yet all members of the site are part of it. If you want to open up your site to both visitors and registered users, use this group to do it.
<p>

<b>Package Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to add, edit, and delete packages of wobjects and pages to deploy.
<p>

<b>Registered Users</b><br>
When users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.
<p>

<b>Style Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit styles for this site. These privileges do not allow the user to assign privileges to a page, just define them to be used.
<p>

<b>Template Managers</b><br>
Users that have privileges to edit templates for this site.
<p>

<b>Visitors</b><br>
Visitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system. Also, if you wish to punish a registered user you could remove him/her from the Registered Users group and insert him/her into the Visitors group.

When you delete a page you are also deleting the content it contains, all sub-pages connected to this page, and all the content they contain. Be certain that you have already moved all the content you wish to keep before you delete a page.
<p>

As with any delete operation, you are prompted to be sure you wish to proceed with the delete. If you answer yes, the delete will proceed and there is no recovery possible. If you answer no you'll be returned to the prior screen.

		message => q|Think of pages as containers for content. For instance, if you want to write a letter to the editor of your favorite magazine you'd get out a notepad (or open a word processor) and start filling it with your thoughts. The same is true with WebGUI. Create a page, then add your content to the page.
<p>

<b>Title</b><br>
The title of the page is what your users will use to navigate through the site. Titles should be descriptive, but not very long.
<p>


<b>Menu Title</b><br>
A shorter or altered title to appear in navigation. If left blank this will default to <i>Title</i>.
<p>

<b>Page URL</b><br>
When you create a page a URL for the page is generated based on the page title. If you are unhappy with the URL that was chosen, you can change it here.
<p>

<b>Redirect URL</b><br>
When this page is visited, the user will be redirected to the URL specified here. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The redirects will be disabled while in admin mode in order to make it easier to edit the properties of the page.
<p>


<b>Hide from navigation?</b><br>
Select yes to hide this page from the navigation menus and site maps.
<p>
<B>NOTE:</b> This will not hide the page from the page tree (Administrative functions... &gt; Manage page tree.), only from navigation macros and from site maps.
<p>

<b>Open in new window?</b><br>
Select yes to open this page in a new window. This is often used in conjunction with the <b>Redirect URL</b> parameter.
<p>



<b>Language</b><br/>
Choose the default language for this page. All WebGUI generated messages will appear in that language and the character set will be changed to the character set for that language.
<p/>

<P><B>Cache Timeout</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for registered users. 

<P><B>Cache Timeout (Visitors)</B><BR>The amount of time this page should remain cached for visitors. 

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Page caching is only available if your administrator has installed the Cache::FileCache Perl module. Using page caching can improve site performance by as much as 1000%.&nbsp;


<b>Template</b><br>
By default, WebGUI has one big content area to place wobjects. However, by specifying a template other than the default you can sub-divide the content area into several sections.
<p>

<b>Synopsis</b><br>
A short description of a page. It is used to populate default descriptive meta tags as well as to provide descriptions on Site Maps.
<p>

<b>Meta Tags</b><br>
Meta tags are used by some search engines to associate key words to a particular page. You can find a  <a href="http://vancouver-webpages.com/META/mk-metas.html">little utility here</a> that will help you build meta tags if you've never done it before.
<p>

<i>Advanced Users:</i> If you have other things (like JavaScript) you usually put in the  area of your pages, you may put them here as well.
<p>

<b>Use default meta tags?</b><br>
If you don't wish to specify meta tags yourself, WebGUI can generate meta tags based on the page title and your company's name. Check this box to enable the WebGUI-generated meta tags.
<p>


<b>Style</b><br>
By default, when you create a page, it inherits a few traits from its parent. One of those traits is style. Choose from the list of styles if you would like to change the appearance of this page. See <i>Add Style</i> for more details.
<p>

If you select "Yes" below the style pull-down menu, all of the pages below this page will take on the style you've chosen for this page.
<p>

<b>Start Date</b><br>
The date when users may begin viewing this page. Note that before this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>

<b>End Date</b><br>
The date when users will stop viewing this page. Note that after this date only content managers with the rights to edit this page will see it.
<p>


<b>Owner</b><br>
The owner of a page is usually the person who created the page. This user always has full edit and viewing rights on the page.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The owner can only be changed by an administrator.
<p>


<b>Who can view?</b><br>
Choose which group can view this page. If you want both visitors and registered users to be able to view the page then you should choose the "Everybody" group.
<p>

<b>Who can edit?</b><br>
Choose the group that can edit this page. The group assigned editing rights can also always view the page.
<p>

You can optionally recursively give these privileges to all pages under this page.
<p>

<b>What next?</b><br/>
If you leave this on the default setting you'll be redirected to the new page after creating it.

<p/>

<b>&#94;a; or &#94;a(); - My Account Link</b><br>
A link to your account information. In addition you can change the link text by creating a macro like this <b>&#94;a("Account Info");</b>.  If you specify "linkonly" in the first parameter then only the URL will be returned. Also, you can specify the name of a template in the Macro/a_account namespace as the second parameter to override the default template.
<p>

<b>NOTES:</b> You can also use the special case &#94;a(linkonly); to return only the URL to the account page and nothing more. Also, the .myAccountLink style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>


<b>&#94;AdminText();</b><br>
Displays a small text message to a user who is in admin mode. Example: &#94;AdminText("You are in admin mode!");
<p>

<b>&#94;AdminToggle; or &#94;AdminToggle();</b><br>
Places a link on the page which is only visible to content managers and adminstrators. The link toggles on/off admin mode. You can optionally specify other messages to display like this: &#94;AdminToggle("Edit On","Edit Off"); This macro optionally takes a third parameter that allows you to specify an alternate template name in the Macro/AdminToggle namespace.
<p>

<b>&#94;CanEditText();</b><br>
Display a message to a user that can edit the current page.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;CanEditText(^AdminToggle;);
<p>

<b>&#94;EditableToggle; or &#94;EditableToggle();</b><br>
Exactly the same as AdminToggle, except that the toggle is only displayed if the user has the rights to edit the current page. This macro takes up to three parameters. The first is a labe for "Turn Admin On", the second is a label for "Turn Admin Off", and the third is the name of a template in the Macro/EditableToggle namespace to replace the default template.
<p>

<b>&#94;GroupAdd();</b><br>
Using this macro you can allow users to add themselves to a group. The first parameter is the name of the group this user should be added to. The second parameter is a text string for the user to click on to add themselves to this group. The third parameter allows you to specify the name of a template in the Macro/GroupAdd namespace to replace the default template.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If the user is not logged in, or or already belongs to the group, or the group is not set to allow auto adds, then no link will be displayed.
<p>


<b>&#94;GroupDelete();</b><br>
Using this macro you can allow users to delete themselves from a group. The first parameter is the name of the group this user should be deleted from. The second parameter is a text string for the user to click on to delete themselves from this group. The third parameter allows you to specify the name of a template in the Macro/GroupDelete namespace to replace the default template.
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If the user is not logged in or the user does not belong to the group, or the group is not set to allow auto deletes, then no link will be displayed.
<p>

<b>&#94;GroupText();</b><br>
Displays a small text message to the user if they belong to the specified group. And you can specify an alternate message to those who are not in the group.
<p>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;GroupText("Visitors","You need an account to do anything cool on this site!","We value our registered users!");
<p>

<b>&#94;L; or &#94;L(); - Login Box</b><br>
A small login form. You can also configure this macro. You can set the width of the login box like this &#94;L(20);. You can also set the message displayed after the user is logged in like this &#94;L(20,Hi &#94;a(&#94;@;);. Click %here% if you wanna log out!)
<p>

<b>NOTE:</b> The .loginBox style sheet class is tied to this macro.
<p>

<b>&#94;LoginToggle; or &#94;LoginToggle();</b><br>
Displays a "Login" or "Logout" message depending upon whether the user is logged in or not. You can optionally specify other labels like this: &#94;LoginToggle("Click here to log in.","Click here to log out.");. You can also use the special case &#94;LoginToggle(linkonly); to return only the URL with no label.
<p>

<b>&#94;@; - Username</b><br>
The username of the currently logged in user.
<p>


<b>&#94;#; - User ID</b><br>
The user id of the currently logged in user.

<p>

<b>position<i>X</i>_loop</b><br>
The loop that defines a page position and contains a list of wobjects for that position. Replace <i>X</i> with a number, so position one would be <i>position1_loop</i>, and position two would be <i>position2_loop</i>, etc.
<blockquote>

<b>wobject.canView</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to view this wobject. 
<p>

<b>wobject.canEdit</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to edit this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.controls</b><br>
The toolbar for manipulating the properties of this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.namespace</b><br>
The namespace of this wobject. This is also known as the wobject type, for instance Article, USS, SQLReport, and SiteMap are all namespaces.
<p>

<b>wobject.id</b><br>
The unique identifier for this wobject.
<p>

<b>wobject.isInDateRange</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the wobject is scheduled to be displayed right now. The variable <i>wobject.canView</i> already takes this into account, but content managers can always view content, so this is an extra check so they don't have to see the wobject if it's not scheduled to appear yet, or if it's end date has already passed.
<p>

<b>wobject.content</b><br>
The content produced by the wobject.
<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> The position elements can go up to 1 billion, which should be more than enough for the average site.

<p>

<b>page.canEdit</b><br>
A condition indicating whether the current user has the privileges to edit this page.
<p>

<b>page.controls</b><br>

	},

	'826' => {
		message => q|WebGUI has a powerful templating language built to give you maximum control over the layout of your content. The following is a list of the template language syntax.

<p/>
<b>NOTE:</b> Please note that the words <i>foo</i> and <i>bar</i> are used below as placeholders for the actual variable names that you'll use. They are not part of the template language.

<p/>
<b>Variables</b><br/>
Variables are the most basic of the template commands. They are used to position pieces of content.

<p/>
<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_var foo&gt; or &lt;tmpl_var name="foo"&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> &lt;tmpl_var name&gt;
<p/>

<b>Conditions</b><br/>
To programmers conditions are nothing new, but to designers they can often be confusing at first. Conditions are really just true or false questions, and if you think of them that way, you'll have no trouble at all.
<p/>

<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_if foo&gt; &lt;tmpl_else&gt; &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;
<br/>
<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_unless foo&gt; &lt;tmpl_else&gt; &lt;/tmpl_unless&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> &lt;tmpl_if isTrue&gt; It was true!&lt;tmpl_else&gt; It was false! &lt;/tmpl_if&gt;
<p/>

<b>Loops</b><br/>
Loops iterate over a list of data output for each pass in the loop. Loops are slightly more complicated to use than plain variables, but are considerably more powerful.
<p/>

<i>Syntax:</i> &lt;tmpl_loop foo&gt; &lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
<p/>

<i>Example:</i> <br/>
&lt;tmpl_loop users&gt; <br/>
  &nbsp; Name: &lt;tmpl_var first_name&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br/>
&lt;/tmpl_loop&gt;
<p/>

<b>Loop Conditions</b><br/>
Loops come with special condition variables of their own. They are __FIRST__, __ODD__, __INNER__, and __LAST__.
<p/>

<i>Examples:</i><br/>
<pre>
   &lt;TMPL_LOOP FOO&gt;
      &lt;TMPL_IF __FIRST__&gt;
        This only outputs on the first pass.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __ODD__&gt;
        This outputs every other pass, on the odd passes.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_UNLESS __ODD__&gt;
        This outputs every other pass, on the even passes.
      &lt;/TMPL_UNLESS&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __INNER__&gt;
        This outputs on passes that are neither first nor last.
      &lt;/TMPL_IF&gt;

      &lt;TMPL_IF __LAST__&gt;
        This only outputs on the last pass.
      &lt;TMPL_IF&gt;
   &lt;/TMPL_LOOP&gt;

<p>
The following style sheet classes are available:
<p>

<b>.tab</b><br>
The default look of each tab.
<p>

<b>div.tabs</b><br>
This also sets some properties for all of the tabs. This should be used for the text labels in the tabs.
<p>


<b>.tabBody</b><br>
The content area for each tab. This is where the form will show up. Note that for best results the background color of this should match the background color of .tabActive.
<p>


<b>.tabHover</b><br>
The look of a tab as the mouse hovers over it.
<p>

<b>.tabActive</b><br>
The look of the tab that is currently visible.
<p>



<i>Examples</i><br>
You can use these instead of creating your own if you wish. Or just use these as guidelines for creating your own.
<p>
<table width="100%"><tr><td valign="top">
<b>White or Light Colored Styles</b>

		message => q|These macros are designed to provide programming-like functionality. They are powerful when used appropriately, and dangerous when used carelessly. Take care when using these macros.

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> These macros are included in WebGUI in order to provide very powerful display mechanisms. Though they could be used to write simple web applications, this is not their intended use, nor is it supported or condoned by Plain Black. If you find yourself trying to do something like that, just write a macro. =) <b>By default these macros are disabled to protect the security of your site and server, and only your administrator can enable them.</b>

<p/>

<b>&#94;D; or &#94;D(); - Date</b><br>
The current date and time.
<p>

You can configure the date by using date formatting symbols. For instance, if you created a macro like this <b>&#94;D("%c %D, %y");</b> it would output <b>September 26, 2001</b>. The following are the available date formatting symbols:
<p>

<table><tbody><tr><td>%%</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>%y</td><td>4 digit year</td></tr><tr><td>%Y</td><td>2 digit year</td></tr><tr><td>%m</td><td>2 digit month</td></tr><tr><td>%M</td><td>variable digit month</td></tr><tr><td>%c</td><td>month name</td></tr><tr><td>%d</td><td>2 digit day of month</td></tr><tr><td>%D</td><td>variable digit day of month</td></tr><tr><td>%w</td><td>day of week name</td></tr><tr><td>%h</td><td>2 digit base 12 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%H</td><td>variable digit base 12 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%j</td><td>2 digit base 24 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%J</td><td>variable digit base 24 hour</td></tr><tr><td>%p</td><td>lower case am/pm</td></tr><tr><td>%P</td><td>upper case AM/PM</td></tr><tr><td>%z</td><td>user preference date format</td></tr><tr><td>%Z</td><td>user preference time format</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>

<b>&#94;Env()</b><br>
Can be used to display a web server environment variable on a page. The environment variables available on each server are different, but you can find out which ones your web server has by going to: http://www.yourwebguisite.com/env.pl
<p>

The macro should be specified like this &#94;Env("REMOTE_ADDR");
<p>

<b>&#94;Execute();</b><br>
Allows a content manager or administrator to execute an external program. Takes the format of <b>&#94;Execute("/this/file.sh");</b>.
<p>


<b>&#94;FormParam();</b><br>
This macro is mainly used in generating dynamic queries in SQL Reports. Using this macro you can pull the value of any form field simply by specifing the name of the form field, like this: &#94;FormParam("phoneNumber");
<p>


<b>&#94;If();</b><br>
A simple conditional statement (IF/THEN/ELSE) to control layout and messages.
<p>
<i>Examples:</i><br>
Display Happy New Year on 1st January:
      &#94;If('&#94;D("%m%d");' eq '0101' , Happy New Year);
<p>
Display a message to people on your subnet (192.168.1.*):<br>
&#94;If('&#94;Env("REMOTE_ADDR");' =~ /&#94;192.168.1/,"Hi co-worker","Hi Stranger");
<p>
Display a message to Windows users:<br>
      &#94;If('&#94;URLEncode("&#94;Env("HTTP_USER_AGENT");");' =~ /windows/i,"Hey... Linux is free !");
<p>
Display a message if a user is behind a proxy:<br>
      &#94;If('&#94;Env("HTTP_VIA");' ne "", You're behind a proxy !, Proxy-free is the best...);
<p>
Display Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening:<br>
      &#94;If(&#94;D("%J");<=12,Good Morning,&#94;If(&#94;D("%J");<=18,Good Afternoon,Good evening););
<p>

<b>&#94;Include();</b><br>
Allows a content manager or administrator to include a file from the local filesystem. 
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Include("/this/file.html");
<p>

<b>&#94;International();</b><br/>
Pull a translated message from the internationalization system.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;International(45,"Article");
<p/>


<b>&#94;Quote();</b><br>
Use this to escape a string before using it in a database query.
<p>


<b>&#94;Page();</b><br>
This can be used to retrieve information about the current page. For instance it could be used to get the page URL like this &#94;Page("urlizedTitle"); or to get the menu title like this &#94;Page("menuTitle");.
<p>

<b>&#94;SQL();</b><br>
A one line SQL report. Sometimes you just need to pull something back from the database quickly. This macro is also useful in extending the SQL Report wobject. It uses the numeric macros (&#94;0; &#94;1; &#94;2; etc) to position data and can also use the ^rownum; macro just like the SQL Report wobject. Examples:<p>
 &#94;SQL("select count(*) from users","There are &#94;0; users on this system.");
<p>
&#94;SQL("select userId,username from users order by username","&lt;a href='^/;?op=viewProfile&uid=&#94;0;'&gt;^1;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;");
<p>
<b>&#94;URLEncode();</b><br>
This macro is mainly useful in SQL reports, but it could be useful elsewhere as well. It takes the input of a string and URL Encodes it so that the string can be passed through a URL. It's syntax looks like this: &#94;URLEncode("Is this my string?");
<p>


<b>&#94;User();</b><br>
This macro will allow you to display any information from a user's account or profile. For instance, if you wanted to display a user's email address you'd create this macro: &#94;User("email");
<p>

<b>&#94;*; or &#94;*(); - Random Number</b><br>
A randomly generated number. This is often used on images (such as banner ads) that you want to ensure do not cache. In addition, you may configure this macro like this <b>&#94;*(100);</b> to create a random number between 0 and 100.
<p>

<b>&#94;-;,&#94;0;,&#94;1;,&#94;2;,&#94;3;, etc.</b><br>
These macros are reserved for system/wobject-specific functions as in the SQL Report wobject and the Body in the Style Manager.

You cannot import a theme twice. If you wish to import a new version of a theme, then you must first delete the previous version of the theme.

You also cannot import a theme from a version of WebGUI that is newer than the one you're using. Therefore if you are using WebGUI 5.2.4 and a theme was created with WebGUI 6.0.0, then you will not be allowed to import the theme until you upgrade.

This macro builds a quick file link. It creates an icon for the file and outputs the files name. Then it links them both to the file for downloading.
<p/>

<b>&#94;I();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves an image from the collateral management system along with an HTML image tag so that you can quickly display an image from the repository in your content.

<i>Example:</i> &#94;RandomImage("site headers");
<p />

<b>&#94;RandomSnippet();</b><br/>
This macro takes a collateral folder as a parameter. If the folder name is omitted, then the root folder will be used. The macro then randomly chooses a snippet from the folder and returns it in much the same way the &#94;Snippet(); macro works.
<p />
<i>Example:</i> &#94;RandomSnippet("quips");
<p />


<b>&#94;SI();</b><br/>
The Scaled Image macro allows images to be found in the collateral and scaled (on the server-side), either maintaining the original aspect ratio or an entirely new ratio of your design. 
<p>
It takes four parameters. The first is the image name or optionally the collateral id. The second is the width. Set the width to "0" to maintain aspect ratio by height. The third is height. Set the height to "0" to maintain aspect ratio by width. The fourth parameter allows you to specify additional parameters to the image.
<p />
<i>Examples:</i><br>
Retrieving an image by name (no scaling)<br>
^SI(myimage);
<p>
Retrieving an image by collateralId (no scaling)<br>
^SI(66);
<p>
Scaling by width, maintaining aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,25);
<p>
Scaling by height, maintaining aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,0,25);
<p>
Playing with the aspect ratio<br>
^SI(66,148,25);
<p>
Using parameters<br>
^SI(66,0,0,'border="0"');
<p />


<b>&#94;Snippet();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves the contents of a snippet in the collateral management system and inserts it into the page. You can optionally specify up to 9 additional parameters that will be replace these special characters in the snippet: ^1; ^2; ^3; ^4; ^5; ^6; ^7; ^8; ^9;
<p />
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Snippet("flash code");
<p />

<b>&#94;Thumbnail();</b><br/>
This macro retrieves the URL for the thumbnail of any image in the collateral management system.
<p/>
<i>Example:</i> &#94;Thumbnail("logo");

		message => q|See <i>Manage Group</i> for a description of grouping functions and the default groups.
<p>

<b>Group Name</b><br>
A name for the group. It is best if the name is descriptive so you know what it is at a glance.
<p>

<b>Description</b><br>
A longer description of the group so that other admins and content managers (or you if you forget) will know what the purpose of this group is.
<p>

<b>Expire Offset</b><br>
The amount of time that a user will belong to this group before s/he is expired (or removed) from it. This is very useful for membership sites where users have certain privileges for a specific period of time. 
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This can be overridden on a per-user basis.
<p>

<b>Notify user about expiration?</b><br>
Set this value to yes if you want WebGUI to contact the user when they are about to be expired from the group.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the notification. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the notification to be sent on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the notification to go out 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the notification to be sent 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Expire Notification Message</b><br>
Type the message you wish to be sent to the user telling them about the expiration.
<p>

<b>Delete Offset</b><br>
The difference in the number of days from the expiration to the grouping being deleted from the system. You may set this to any valid integer. For instance, set this to "0" if you wish the grouping to be deleted on the same day that the grouping expires. Set it to "-7" if you want the grouping to be deleted 7 days <b>before</b> the grouping expires. Set it to "7" if you wish the grouping to be deleted 7 days after the expiration.
<p>

<b>Scratch Filter</b><br>
A user can be dynamically bound to a group by a scratch variable in their session. Scratch variables can be set programatically, or via the web. To set a scratch variable via the web, tack the following on to the end of any URL:
<p>
<i>?op=setScratch&scratchName=somename&scratchValue=somevalue</i>
<p>
Having done that, when a user clicks on that link they will have a scratch variable added to their session with a name of "www_somename" and a value of "somevalue". The "www_" is prepended to prevent web requests from overwriting scratch variables that were set programatically.
<p>
To set a scratch filter simply add a line to the scratch filter field that looks like:
<p>
<i>www_somename=somevalue</i>
<p>

<b>IP Address</b><br>
Specify an IP address or an IP mask to match. If the user's IP address matches, they'll automatically be included in this group. An IP mask is simply the IP address minus an octet or two. You may also specify multiple IP masks separated by semicolons.
<p>
<i>IP Mask Example:</i> 10.;192.168.;101.42.200.142
<p>

<b>Karma Threshold</b><br>
If you've enabled Karma, then you'll be able to set this value. Karma Threshold is the amount of karma a user must have to be considered part of this group.
<p>


<b>Users can add themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users add themselves to this group? See the GroupAdd macro for more info.
<p>

<b>Users can remove themselves?</b><br>
Do you wish to let users remove themselves from this group? See the GroupDelete macro for more info.
<p>

<i>The following options are recommended only for advanced WebGUI administrators.</i>
<p>

<b>Database Link</b><br>
If you'd like to have this group validate users using an external database, choose the database link to use.
<p>

<b>SQL Query</b><br>
Many organizations have external databases that map users to groups; for example an HR database might map Employee ID to Health Care Plan.  To validate users against an external database, you need to construct a SQL statement that will return 1 if a user is in the group.  Make sure to begin your statement with "select 1".  You may use macros in this query to access data in a user's profile, such as Employee ID.  Here is an example that checks a user against a fictional HR database.  This assumes you have created an additional profile field called employeeId.<br>
<br>
select 1 from employees, health_plans, empl_plan_map<br>
where employees.employee_id = ^User("employeeId");<br>
and health_plans.plan_name = 'HMO 1'<br>
and employees.employee_id = empl_plan_map.employee_id<br>
and health_plans.health_plan_id = empl_plan_mp.health_plan_id<br>
<br>
This group could then be named "Employees in HMO 1", and would allow you to restrict any page or wobject to only those users who are part of this health plan in the external database.
<p>

<b>Cache external groups for how long?</b><br>
Large sites using external group data will be making many calls to the external database.  To help reduce the load, you may select how long you'd like to cache the results of the external database query within the WebGUI database.  More advanced background caching may be included in a future version of WebGUI.|,

		message => q|Style templates are a special kind of template in WebGUI. They allow you to keep your content seperated from the look and feel of your site. The following are the template variables available in style templates:

<p>

<b>body.content</b><br>
The the content on the current page.
<p>

<b>head.tags</b><br>
Tags that WebGUI automatically generates for you so that caching works the way it should, search engines can find you better, and other useful automated functionality. This should go in the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; section of your style.

<p>
In addition to the above tags all of the session variables are made available to you just like any other template. We suggest using something like this in the &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; portion of your style:
<p>

&lt;tmpl_var session.page.title&gt; - &lt;tmpl_var session.setting.companyName&gt;

<p>
Following a guide like the above will help you get good ranking on search engines.
