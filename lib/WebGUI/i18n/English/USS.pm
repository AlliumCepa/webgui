		message => q|User Submission Systems (USS) are a great way to add a sense of community to any site as well as get free content from your users. The User Submission System name is misleading to some people, because they immediately think of users as visitors. However, users are also staff, or business partners, or even yourself. With the USS you can select who can add new content, and even who can moderate that content.
<br><br>
User Submission systems are so versatile that they allow you to create all kinds of applications, just by editing a few templates. Example applications are Photo Galleries, FAQs, Link Lists, Guest Books, Classifieds, and more.

<b>Sort By</b><br>

<p>




<b>Who can approve?</b><br>
What group is allowed to approve and deny content?
<br><br>

<b>Who can contribute?</b><br>
What group is allowed to contribute content?
<br><br>


<b>Default Status</b><br>
Should submissions be set to <i>Approved</i>, <i>Pending</i>, or <i>Denied</i> by default?
<br><br>
<i>Note:</i> If you set the default status to Pending, then be prepared to monitor your message log for new submissions.
<p>

<b>Karma Per Submission</b><br>
How much karma should be given to a user when they contribute to this user submission system?
<p>
