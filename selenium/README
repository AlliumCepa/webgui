Install WebGUI using to the instructions at:  https://github.com/plainblack/webgui/tree/WebGUI8

Create the following settings in your test site webgui.conf file:

"selenium" : {
    "server"  : "localhost",
    "port" : "4444",
    "browser" : "firefox",
    "webgui_url" : "http://whatever-your-site-is.com"
},

Download the Selenium server from: http://seleniumhq.org/download/)
   as of this writing it was selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar
  
Running the Selenium Server (run in a separate command line/window)
   java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar
   
   The -browserSessionReuse is to keep the selenium session open so you may troubleshoot page issues (helpful for test writers)
   The Selenium software automatically closes the browser when the tests are concluded.  If you are writing/troubleshooting tests
   and need the browser to remain open use:
   java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar -browserSessionReuse

The test.pl script can setup your WebGUI test site automagically (perl test.pl install)
or you can setup the WebGUI test site yourself.  If you choose to setup the WebGUI site yourself
please make sure you select all the defaults (do not change the "admin" user password) and 
pick the site design: "Style 03"  (This is the style selected for testing)
   
Running the WebGUI tests (run in a separate command line/window)
   cd /data/WebGUI/selenium
   perl test.pl [install]

       perl -pi -e 's/webgui.dbash.com/whatever-your-site-is.com/' *.html
       
   Selenium server not running (this may vary according to the values in your webgui.conf file):

      500 Can't connect to localhost:4444 (Connection refused)

Optional:

   500 Can't connect to localhost:4444 (Connection refused)
   # Looks like your test exited with 61 before it could output anything.
   --- this means you forgot to run the Selenium server or you are not running the Selenium server on the same
   host:port as specified in your webgui.conf file.
   
   $perl test.pl
   ok 1 - Login test
   Error requesting http://localhost:4444/selenium-server/driver/:
   Timed out after 30000ms
   # Looks like you planned 159 tests but ran 1.
   # Looks like your test exited with 255 just after 1.
   --- make sure your webgui test system is running and the "webgui_url" value in your selenium.conf is the same as the
   address to your WebGUI test system
