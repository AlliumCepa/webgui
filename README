This is the PSGI branch of WebGUI8

Currently, the best performance is achieved via:

 plackup -E none -s Starman --workers 10
 
You can benchmark your server via:

 ab -t 3 -c 10 -k http://dev.localhost.localdomain:5000/ | grep Req
 
I'm currently getting 20 requests/second, whereas I'm getting 30/second on the non-PSGI WebGUI8 branch.
