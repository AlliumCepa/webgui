This is an experimental installer for WebGUI8 that attempts to use the
system package manager rather than the WRE.  It is currently incomplete --
it doesn't set up WebGUI or MySQL to run at boot time, and it doesn't
set up cron, and a few other things.  It also needs to be packaged up
with its dependencies with PAR or FatPacker or the like.

It attempts to gracefully handle running with user permission.  It
uses a Curses interface, asking the user about install options
(paths and passwords and such), and getting confirmation before running
commands.

At this point, it stumbles through the install process on a Debian machine
that already has MySQL installed but I haven't actually tried firing up the
nginx and WebGUI.
