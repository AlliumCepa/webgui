This is an experimental installer for WebGUI8 that attempts to use the
system package manager rather than the WRE.  It currently targets
CentOS and Debian.

It is currently incomplete -- it doesn't set up WebGUI to run at boot
time, and it doesn't set up cron, and a few other things.

To run it installer on CentOS, do:

yum install wget 
yum install perl 
wget https://raw.github.com/gist/2973558/webgui_installer.pl --no-check-certificate
perl webgui_installer.pl

To run it installer on Debian, do:

apt-get install wget
apt-get install perl
wget https://raw.github.com/gist/2973558/webgui_installer.pl --no-check-certificate
perl webgui_installer.pl

It uses a Curses interface, asking the user about install options
(paths and passwords and such), and getting confirmation before running
commands.

It has been at points successfully tested on Debian 32 bit and CentOS 64
bit.

It asks for your sudo password and attempts to use that if run as a user,
but this is less well tested.  There's some goo in the code for attempting
a user level permission install but that's incomplete.  For now, running
as root is recommended.

Curses, Curses::UI, and the setupfiles and docs directory are bundled
into the __DATA__ section of the webgui_installer.pl script.  If changes
are made to those files in the github repo, the __DATA__ section of
the installer needs to be updated with uuencoded copies.
