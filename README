This is an experimental installer for WebGUI8 that attempts to use the
system package manager rather than the WRE.  It is currently incomplete --
it doesn't set up WebGUI or MySQL to run at boot time, and it doesn't
set up cron, and a few other things.

It attempts to gracefully handle running with user permission.  It
uses a Curses interface, asking the user about install options
(paths and passwords and such), and getting confirmation before running
commands.

At this point, for me, it stumbles through the install process on a 32
bit Debian machine.  More testing is needed.

Curses, Curses::UI, and the setupfiles and docs directory are bundled
into the __DATA__ section of the webgui_installer.pl script.  If changes
are made to those files in the github repo, the __DATA__ section of
the installer needs to be updated with uuencoded copies.
