This file contains a list of any changes you should be aware of when
upgrading from one version to the next, or even between multiple
versions. Be sure to heed the warnings contained herein as they will
save you many hours of grief.

6.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If you're using languages other than English, you'll need to get
	new versions of those language files before upgrading. The
	language file format has a new requirement. Also, the
	language files are now all converted to UTF-8.

 * If you were using any non-English language files on your site,
	you may now have to convert your site content to UTF-8
	format. Check with your language file provider for details.


6.2.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Due to a bug in the theme system, if you created any themes in any
	6.2.x version prior to 6.2.8 they will need to be deleted and
	recreated. Otherwise they will export a corrupt theme file.


6.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * If you used 6.1.1 for a while, and feel like there's something
	wrong with your navigation or page tree, then there just
	might be. We corrected a rather large problem in the Page
	system that could have caused page tree corruption. To test
	and fix this problem, get the page tree tools from the user
	contribs area of plainblack.com. Be sure to back up your
	databases before using this tool.


6.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WebGUI now requires Time::HiRes to operate. Be sure to have it 
	installed prior to upgrading or the the upgrade will fail.

 * Parts of the WebGUI API have changed once again, so be sure that
	any third-party plug-ins you have installed have been updated
	to work with 6.2 before upgrading.

 * A new configuration option has been introduced: 
	exportPath = /path/to/export/dir
	If exportPath is defined in the WebGUI config file, a new 
	"Export" icon will appear in the page toolbar.


6.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in plug-in coding.

 * You no longer need Data::Serializer.

 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in the template system.

 * See docs/migration.txt for changes in the Internationalization
	and help systems.

 * If you're using any third-party plug-ins, you'll need to get
	updated versions to work with 6.1.

 * If you're using a language other than English on your current site,
 	you'll need to obtain a language pack from either the user
	contributions or one of the WebGUI Worldwide sites.

 * Each user's language has been reset to the default language for
	the site as specified in the profile settings.

 * We removed a bunch of the cryptic-hack code that was allowing
	backward compatibility all the way back to some 2.x, 3.x, and
	4.x stuff. To be sure that your site will still work, copy
	the gateway script (index.pl) over your old one. Also make
	sure you have extrasPath and extrasURL defined in your config
	file.

 * The ThumbnailLinker macro has been removed. You can now use the
	Thumbnail macro because it is templated.


6.0.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * You need to add all of your site aliases to the sitename variable
        in your WebGUI config file.


6.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Apache 2.0 is now the recommended web server for WebGUI. As such
	sbin/preload.perl has been defaulted for use with mod_perl
	2.0. If you are still using Apache 1.3, don't worry, WebGUI
	will still work great for you. You just need to edit
	sbin/preload.perl to match your environment.


6.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * As part of the upgrade process our scripts will attempt to
	migrate your styles, page, FAQ, Item, Link List, and
	SQL Report templates. However, the migration scripts are not
	perfect due to the wide-variety of templates out there, so
	you may need to update some portions of your templates
	manually.

 * The Authentication Module API has been completely rewritten.
	Please see docs/migration.txt for details.

 * The Paginator API has been significantly changed.
	Please see docs/migration.txt for details.

 * WebGUI now requires the following Perl modules to be installed:
	Data::Serializer
	SOAP::Lite
	Cache::Cache (no longer optional)

   WARNING: Be sure you install these modules BEFORE you attempt to
	upgrade or the upgrade will fail and you'll have a mess to
	clean up!

 * If you've created any custom Events Calendar templates, they will
	no longer work due to the new template structure for events
	calendars. Your old templates will remain intact, however,
	so that you can migrate them manually to the new template
	variables.

 * The Synopsis macro no longer exists. If you were using it to
	retrieve the current page's synopsis, then please use the
	^Page("synopsis"); macro. If you were using it to build a
	synopsis style navigation please use the new ^Navigation();
	macro.

 * The old navigation system has been entirely replaced. If you've
	built or are using any navigation components that did not
	come with WebGUI then you'll need to remove them and use
	the new configurable navigation system. See migration.txt
	for additional details.

 * The old realtime search subsystem has been replaced with the new
	indexed search wobject. As such, we've removed the ^?; macro.
	If you were using the ^?; macro then you'll need to set up
	a search wobject to replace it.
 
 * Themes that were created with 5.x versions of WebGUI will fail to
	import into WebGUI 6.0. Sometime after the release of 6.0
	(gamma) there will be a theme converter available on
	plainblack.com to convert your old 5.x themes into 6.0
	themes. If you've already imported a 5.x theme you have
	nothing to worry about. All of the theme components will
	automatically be converted to 6.0.

 * If you have any SQL Reports going against any USS, they will need
	to be updated as the USS tables have changed.

 * During the upgrade process you may see some database errors during
	the migration of SQL Reports. Don't be alarmed. Your upgrade
	has not failed. Instead, some of the queries in the SQL Reports
	may have failed and will cause the SQL Report templates to not
	be automatically generated.
