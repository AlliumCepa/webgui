5. System Changes Affecting Migration
-------------------------------------

5.1 Set Date Format Changes

In 6.0 the "set date" format used by WebGUI::Form::date() and other methods
was changed from "MM/DD/YYYY" to "YYYY-MM-DD" and optionally "YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS". If you are using WebGUI::FormProcessor to handle processing of your
dates then you will notice no side effects from the format change. If you are
not, then you should convert your plugin to use WebGUI::FormProcessor.

In addition to the format change above, we also made one related API change.
WebGUI::Form::dateTime() and WebGUI::HTMLForm->dateTime() no longer have
"dateExtras" and "timeExtras", but rather just "extras" properties. This is
because there is only one field to represent both the date and the time,
unlike before.

5.2 Database Links

The database links API was changed in 6.0. The getHash function was removed and
replaced with a getList function that returns a hash reference.
