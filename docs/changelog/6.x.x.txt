 - Fixes to online help content. (Colin Kuskie)


6.1.1
 - bugfix [ 991313 ] Manage Translations doesn't work
 - bugfix [ 991677 ] Preload erro my $i earlier declaration
 - bugfix [ 991200 ] scriptUrl option in webgui.conf ignored


6.1.0
 - Changed the output of upgrade.pl for better understanding.
 - Added a --history option to upgrade.pl that displays the upgrade history
   for each site.
 - Fixed a typo in User.pm
 - All plugins are now dynamically loaded. This provides a performance gain of
   over 100% in CGI mode, 10% in mod_perl mode, and less memory usage in
   mod_perl mode.
 - Changed the privileges API significantly. See docs/migration.txt for details.
 - Fixed a bug in articles where articles with no content would fail to
   display their images.
 - bugfix [966466] WebGUI::Session. System crash when user language setting missing.
 - Eliminated the need for Data::Serializer which results in a small amount of
   less memory usage.
 - Rewrote the template API which resulted in a 30% performance increase. See
   docs/migration.txt for details.
 - Added five new caching mechanisms for templates. Each has their own
   benefits and detriments. This allows you to increase scalability and
   performance at a cost of either memory or disk space or both. The gains
   here are primarily enjoyed by large heavy traffic sites that use lots of 
   complex templates.
 - Added convenience methods to Wobject superclass for internationalization,
   wobject ID, and namespace.
 - Added an object-oriented interface to the internationalization system. The
   old procedural interface still works as well.
 - Added on the wire compression to HTTP transport for WSClient wobject.  This
   will have no effect on clients/servers that can't support compression.
 - A small patch from Roy Johnson to deal with different types of WSDLs in the
   WSClient.
 - Adding form param WSClient_skipCache when posting to WSClient wobject
   allows us to ignore even good soap return caches (mostly for testing use)
 - Moved to a compiled internationalization and help system. At a cost of 400 
   kilobytes of RAM, it provides a boost in performance of over 35%. More
   importantly though, it cuts the number of database queries in half on an
   average page, which leads to much greater scalability. See
   docs/migration.txt for API changes.
 - Added the ability to select session v. global caches to WSClient.
 - Rmoved the httpHeader, httpRedirect, and setCookie subs from
   WebGUI::Session and created a new class called WebGUI::HTTP for them. See
   docs/migration.txt for details.
 - The USS automatically adds an RSS feed link tag to the head of any page
   it's on.
 - Added a new API for dynamically adding javascript, css, xml, rss, and meta
   information to the page. See WebGUI::Style for details.
 - Fixed a long standing annoyance that javascripts used by the WebGUI::Form
   would be loaded multiple times if there were multiple fields of the same
   type in the same form.
 - Sped up the page editing page by 50% by rearranging the javascript on the
   page.
 - Added prepared statement handlers to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added transaction handlers to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added additional debugging to WebGUI::SQL.
 - Added a better user search mechanism, which works well even with 100,000
   users.
 - Made some minor changes to grouping lookups that resulted in an average of
   18 less database queries per page when in admin mode which results in a 32%
   performance gain while in admin mode.
 - Changed the group and user management interfaces to work and scale better 
   with thousands of users and groups.
 - Changed the config loader to preload the WebGUI config files into memory at
   a cost of ~70k (mem) per site for a 2000% performance gain. It is a huge
   gain, but it was already really fast, so relatively users aren't likely to
   notice the difference. However, this change helps in the overall
   scalability of WebGUI under load.
 - Added the ability to use replicated slave databases to lessen the load on
   the master database. This will have no effect on single database users, but
   can add a tremendous amount of scalability on large WebGUI sites that use
   database replication.
 - Templated the EditableToggle, a, GroupAdd, GroupDelete, H, LoginToggle, r, 
   and AdminToggle macros. Thanks to Colin Kuskie.
