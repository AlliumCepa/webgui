The content managers group should not be used to control individual content areas within the site, but to determine whether a user can edit content at all. You should set up additional groups to separate content areas on the site.\r\n\r\n<b>Registered Users</b>\r\nWhen users are added to the system they are put into the registered users group. A user should only be removed from this group if their account is deleted or if you wish to punish a troublemaker.\r\n\r\n<b>Visitors</b>\r\nVisitors are users who are not logged in using an account on the system.
